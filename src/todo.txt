remove bitvector completely (light of truth)
get rid of affect_modify_char in handler.c
missed some things that should go in extra flag cache
need to test imm/res/vuln mods
equip/unequip char calling mods?
do we need affect_add_perm_to_char?
con and stat need to be consistent with showing aff/vuln, and not show blanks
go through calls to check_immune, a lot of them should be handled by saves vs damage type instead
right now dispel/cancel/undo, each affect of a composite like 'frenzy' saves vs spell individually, fix?


to WBI:
make cure blindness able to cure other forms (dirt kicking, etc) since they can't be undone now
