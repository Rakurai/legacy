replace is_affected with affect_find_on_*
replace affect_flag_on_* with appropriate bit conversion
grep for affects again, see if any old functions re-added by merge
remove bitvector completely (light of truth)
remove imm/res/vuln flags (even temporarily)
get rid of affect_modify_char in handler.c
missed some things that should go in extra flag cache
get_true_hitroll/damroll still used?
need to test imm/res/vuln mods
equip/unequip char calling mods?
need to replace old imm_shadow bit
fix fly/land thing
