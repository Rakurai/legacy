need to test imm/res/vuln mods
do we need affect_add_perm_to_char?
con and stat need to be consistent with showing aff/vuln, and not show blanks


to WBI:
make cure blindness able to cure other forms (dirt kicking, etc) since they can't be undone now
right now dispel/cancel/undo, each affect of a composite like 'frenzy' saves vs spell individually, fix?
go through calls to check_immune, a lot of them should be handled by saves vs damage type instead
