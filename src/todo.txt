replace is_affected with affect_find_on_*
replace affect_flag_on_* with appropriate bit conversion
grep for affects again, see if any old functions re-added by merge
remove bitvector completely (light of truth)
remove imm/res/vuln flags (even temporarily)
get rid of affect_modify_char in handler.c
missed some things that should go in extra flag cache
get_true_hitroll/damroll still used?
need to test imm/res/vuln mods
equip/unequip char calling mods?
need to replace old imm_shadow bit
fix fly/land thing
look at how familiar stat bonus is handled
make sure imm/res/vuln is handled right with calls to check_immune
there are a few things that strip all from char, make sure they add back appropriate affects
defense_mod needs to save to pfile, but maybe not racial bits, and use a dict rather than array.  taken out for now
do we need affect_add_perm_to_char?
remort affects can be regular affects, but probably need a TO_REMORT where type (to identify them for removal)
get the rest of the attribute types using the new form (sex, etc)
get rid of extra attribute types (sheen, focus, saving_spell, etc)
