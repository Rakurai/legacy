remove bitvector completely (light of truth)
get rid of affect_modify_char in handler.c
missed some things that should go in extra flag cache
get_true_hitroll/damroll still used?  what about GET_HITROLL?
need to test imm/res/vuln mods
equip/unequip char calling mods?
look at how familiar stat bonus is handled
defense_mod needs to save to pfile, but maybe not racial bits, and use a dict rather than array.  taken out for now
do we need affect_add_perm_to_char?
remort affects can be regular affects, but probably need a TO_REMORT where type (to identify them for removal)
get the rest of the attribute types using the new form (sex, etc)
get rid of extra attribute types (sheen, focus, saving_spell, etc)
con and stat need to be consistent with showing aff/vuln, and not show blanks
go through calls to check_immune, a lot of them should be handled by saves vs damage type instead
change GET_SEX to just do sex % 3, it'll make change sex work right
right now dispel/cancel/undo, each affect of a composite like 'frenzy' saves vs spell individually, fix?
go through and check for do_* with NULL argument

for flying:
	take care of the 'on' case for furniture
	show_char_to_char
	fix fly/land thing
	swho
	stand, rest, sit, sleep, wake (sneak and hide?)
	check on start_pos, flying chars should start life flying
	also adding gsn_fly should move to flying (unless already exists)
	check for gsn_fly everywhere
	make sure do_land *never* fails to change position from flying, lots of things rely on it with pos checks

to WBI:
make cure blindness able to cure other forms (dirt kicking, etc) since they can't be undone now
