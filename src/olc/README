	To make this thing work :

	1) Get Rom24b6.tar.gz from Russ Taylor's homepage...this won't
	   work on any other version.

	2) Uncompress it, and copy patch.olc into Rom24/src .

	3) cd to Rom24/src, and do a 'patch < patch.olc' .

	4) Copy all the .c and .h files from this distribution to
	   Rom24/src .

	4) Now do a 'make' and pray :)

	5) Copy olc.hlp to the Rom24/area directory and add the dummy
	   object that's in the file limbo.are in this distribution
	   to the limbo.are that comes with Rom24.

	6) Add this line to your pfile :

	   Sec 9

	   This will set your security to the highest possible.

	   Add this in top of the 'area.lst' file found in the areas dir:

	   olc.hlp

	7) Run the mud, log in and do an 'asave world', and shutdown.

        8) Now, just run the mud and enjoy a not-so-buggy OLC :)


	This works almost perfectly in my linux box at home so you
	should not have any problems compiling it. Sorry for the
	(nonexistant) helpfiles but I hate writing in english.
	If you have any problems, comments, advise, cool
	games/apps/mp3s or any stuff you can give me, just mail me :)
	Don't mail the ROM list with any problems related with
	compiling this, mail me instead. I'll try to help.
	Don't ask me for english translations of some of the messages
	that you'll find in the code, ask anyone else (learn spanish!).
	And, of course, read the ROM FAQ!
