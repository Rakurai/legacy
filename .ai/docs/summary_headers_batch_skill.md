# Skill System Header Batch Summary (src/include/skill/)

This batch summarizes the header files in `src/include/skill/`, which define the types and interfaces for the skill system in the legacy codebase.

## Files in this batch
- Type.hh (245 LOC): Declares the skill::Type enum class, listing all possible skill types and categories.
- skill.hh (39 LOC): Declares core skill system interfaces and types.

## Key Structures and Concepts
- **skill::Type enum**: Enumerates all skill types, used for player abilities, spells, and other actions.
- **Skill interfaces**: Provide the API for skill lookup, registration, and invocation.

## Dependencies
- These headers are referenced by player, combat, and command logic throughout the codebase.
- The dependency graph shows that these types are foundational for the skill system and are used in both gameplay and internal mechanics.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- Are all skill types in Type.hh actively used, or are some legacy/unused?
- Are there additional skill-related headers or implementation files outside this directory?

This batch summary provides a foundation for understanding the skill systemâ€™s type definitions and interfaces. See the dependency graph for symbol relationships and usage throughout the codebase.
