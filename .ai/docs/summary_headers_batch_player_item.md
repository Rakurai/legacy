# Note, Object Prototype, Object Value, and Player Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- Note.hh
- ObjectPrototype.hh
- ObjectValue.hh
- Player.hh

## Overview
These headers define the in-game note/message system, object prototypes and values, and player-specific data structures. They are essential for player communication, item instantiation, and persistent player state.

### Key Structures and Types
- **Note**: Represents an in-game note/message, with sender, subject, text, and linked list support. Includes board index structures and note recycling.
- **ObjectPrototype**: In-memory representation of an object prototype, including stats, flags, descriptions, and extra descriptors.
- **ObjectValue**: Wrapper for object values, supporting int, Flags, and Vnum types, with arithmetic and comparison operators.
- **Player**: Represents player-specific data (stats, quest info, aliases, flags, timers, etc.) and related helpers.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Note: Note recycling, loading, and formatting; board management.
- ObjectPrototype: Item instantiation, stat/flag management, and extra descriptor handling.
- ObjectValue: Value manipulation, type conversion, and arithmetic.
- Player: Persistent player state, quest tracking, aliases, and timers.

### Dependencies
- Used by player communication, item instantiation, and persistent player state systems.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- Note.hh and Player.hh are central to player experience and may interact with many gameplay systems.
- ObjectPrototype.hh and ObjectValue.hh are essential for item instantiation and manipulation.
