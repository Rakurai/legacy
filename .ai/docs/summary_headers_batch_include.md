# Core Entity Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- Area.hh
- Character.hh
- Object.hh
- Room.hh

## Overview
These headers define the core entities of the game world: areas, characters, objects, and rooms. Each class encapsulates the data and behaviors for its respective domain, supporting the main gameplay loop and world simulation.

### Key Structures and Types
- **Area**: Represents a game area, including its rooms, objects, mobiles, vnum range, and metadata. Handles loading, updating, and resetting.
- **Character**: Represents a player or NPC, with stats, inventory, status flags, group/party info, and macros for attribute and permission checks.
- **Object**: Represents an in-game item, with inventory, ownership, affects, and item properties (type, weight, value, etc.).
- **Room**: Represents a location in the game world, managing exits, contents, affects, flags, and character movement.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Area: Loading from file, creating rooms, updating state, resetting, and managing vnum ranges.
- Character: Stat management, inventory, group/party logic, permission checks, and macros for gameplay logic.
- Object: Inventory management, affect handling, item property access, and destruction/extraction.
- Room: Exit and content management, affect handling, state queries, and character movement.

### Dependencies
- These classes interact with each other (e.g., Area manages Rooms, Characters move between Rooms, Objects are carried by Characters).
- Rely on utility classes such as String, Flags, and Pooled.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- The full set of macros and permission logic in Character.hh may require further review for edge cases.
- Area.hh and Room.hh are tightly coupled to the world and region systems.
