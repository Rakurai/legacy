# Game, Time, and Extra Description Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- ExtraDescr.hh
- Game.hh
- GameTime.hh
- Garbage.hh

## Overview
These headers define supporting structures for extra descriptions, global game state, in-game time, and garbage collection. They are essential for world detail, timekeeping, and system management.

### Key Structures and Types
- **ExtraDescr**: Used for extra descriptions on rooms or objects, supporting look/examine commands with keywords and descriptions.
- **Game**: Static class holding global game state, boot logic, and references to the World object and runtime variables.
- **GameTime**: Represents in-game time, supporting day/night cycles, months, years, and sun state, with update and string helpers.
- **Garbage**: Mixin for marking objects as garbage or not, supporting garbage collection or cleanup logic.

### Key Functions and Operations
- ExtraDescr: Linked list management and recycling for extra descriptions.
- Game: Boot logic, global state management, and world reference.
- GameTime: In-game timekeeping, sun state, and string helpers.
- Garbage: Marking and checking garbage state for cleanup.

### Dependencies
- Used by world, room, object, and system management code.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- Game.hh is central to global state and may interact with many subsystems.
- ExtraDescr.hh is important for world detail and player interaction.
