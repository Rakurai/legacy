# Duel, Descriptor, and Miscellaneous Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- DepartedPlayer.hh
- Descriptor.hh
- Disabled.hh
- Duel.hh

## Overview
These headers define supporting structures for player management, network connections, command disabling, and the duel system. They provide essential infrastructure for player state, admin tools, and PvP gameplay.

### Key Structures and Types

- **Duel / Duel::Arena**: Represents duels between players and the arenas where they occur, tracking participants, timers, and arena rooms.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Descriptor: Connection state management, input/output buffering, and character association.
