# Miscellaneous and Core Constants Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- Actable.hh
- argument.hh
- Clan.hh
- constants.hh

## Overview
These headers provide essential interfaces, argument parsing utilities, clan management, and a comprehensive set of global constants and macros. They underpin many core systems and gameplay mechanics.

### Key Structures and Types
- **Actable**: Interface for objects that can be referenced or acted upon by name.
- **argument.hh**: Utilities and macros for parsing command arguments and entity types.
- **Clan**: Represents player clans, including metadata, vnum ranges, recall location, and war/score tracking.
- **constants.hh**: Defines global constants, macros, and flag values for game parameters, item/room/mob types, color codes, and more.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Actable: identifier() method for name-based referencing.
- argument.hh: Argument parsing for commands, entity type flag macros.
- Clan: Clan management, persistence, and war/score logic.
- constants.hh: Centralized configuration for gameplay, flags, and system-wide values.

### Dependencies
- Used by core entity and system headers, as well as command and gameplay logic.
- constants.hh is referenced throughout the codebase for configuration and flag definitions.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- constants.hh is very large and may require further breakdown or documentation for maintainability.
- argument.hh macros are critical for command parsing and may have edge cases in usage.
