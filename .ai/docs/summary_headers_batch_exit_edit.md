# Exit, Edit, and Equipment Socket Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- EQSocket.hh
- Edit.hh
- Exit.hh
- ExitPrototype.hh

## Overview
These headers define supporting structures for equipment sockets, in-game text editing, and room exits. They are essential for item customization, player editing, and world navigation.

### Key Structures and Types
- **EQSocket**: Represents an equipment socket, with quality and type fields for item customization.
- **Edit**: Used for in-game text editing (notes, descriptions, rooms, help), tracking edit type, line, undo state, and buffers.
- **Exit**: Represents a directional exit from a room, with prototype reference, flags, destination room, and static helpers for direction names and reversals.
- **ExitPrototype**: Template for an exit, including description, keyword, destination vnum, flags, and key.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Edit: In-game editing of text fields for various entities.
- Exit: Navigation between rooms, direction handling, and state management.
- EQSocket: Item socketing and customization.

### Dependencies
- Used by item, room, and world systems for navigation, editing, and customization.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- Edit.hh is central to in-game editing and may interact with many command handlers.
- ExitPrototype.hh and Exit.hh are tightly coupled for room navigation and resets.
