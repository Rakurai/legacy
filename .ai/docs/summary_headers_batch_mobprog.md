# Logging, MobProg, and Mobile Prototype Header Batch Summary (src/include/)

This batch includes the following header files:
- Logging.hh
- MobProg.hh
- MobProgActList.hh
- MobilePrototype.hh

## Overview
These headers define logging utilities, the mobile (NPC) scripting system, and the in-memory representation of mobile prototypes. They are essential for debugging, NPC behavior, and world population.

### Key Structures and Types
- **Logging**: Namespace with functions for logging and bug reporting, including printf-style formatting helpers.
- **MobProg**: Class for mobile (NPC) scripting, with types, argument lists, and command lists. Includes trigger and event functions for various mob actions.
- **MobProgActList**: Linked list structure for queued mob program actions, holding references to characters, objects, and arguments.
- **MobilePrototype**: In-memory representation of a mobile (NPC) prototype, including stats, flags, descriptions, and associated mob programs.

### Key Functions and Operations
- Logging: Logging and bug reporting with formatted output.
- MobProg: Mob program triggers, event handling, and type conversions.
- MobProgActList: Queuing and managing mob program actions.
- MobilePrototype: NPC stats, flags, descriptions, and mob program association.

### Dependencies
- Used by debugging, NPC scripting, and world population systems.

## Open Questions / Assumptions
- MobProg.hh and MobilePrototype.hh are central to NPC behavior and may interact with many gameplay systems.
