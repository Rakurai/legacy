# Migration Project Plan

## Vision & Goals
The primary goal is to modernize the legacy MUD codebase into a Python-based system that is easy to extend, modify, and maintain. The new codebase should:
- Enable rapid onboarding for developers and content creators.
- Minimize the skill requirements to implement new features or ideas.
- Support feature parity with the original game, using the same or ported data.
- Lay the groundwork for future accessibility improvements, such as a web-based client.
- Remain fun and accessible for modern users, while preserving the community-driven spirit of the original game.

## Major Phases & Deliverables
1. **Preparation**
   - Review documentation and migration plan from the documentation generation project.
   - Deliverables: Confirmed migration plan, updated file inventories.
2. **Prototyping, Implementation, and Testing (Per-Feature Basis)**
   - Migrate and implement each major feature (e.g., core IO, UI, world loading, inventory, combat, skills, spells, etc.) one at a time.
   - For each feature:
     - Prototype and validate design decisions.
     - Implement and test the feature in Python.
     - Integrate with other features and update as needed.
   - Deliverables: Feature-specific Python code, tests, and documentation; integration reports as needed.
3. **Integration & Validation**
   - Integrate all features and ensure the system achieves feature parity with the original game.
   - Deliverables: Integrated codebase, system tests, user feedback, and final documentation.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **Human Developer (You):** Guides vision, reviews all changes, clarifies requirements, and makes final decisions.
- **AI Agents:** Assist with code generation, documentation, analysis, and planning. Propose solutions and iterate based on feedback.
- **Code Review:** Every stage includes a review to ensure alignment with the vision and plan. Documentation and plans are updated as needed.

## Workflow & Iteration
Each feature follows this workflow:
1. Review the stage outline to ensure alignment with previous steps and documentation.
2. Review relevant code and documentation.
3. Conduct a Q/A session to clarify and expand the plan into a detailed action plan.
4. Update stage documentation to reflect the plan.
5. Execute the plan (AI agent/human collaboration).
6. Pause for clarification if issues arise.
7. Fully describe the reasoning and changes made.
8. Iterate until the result is satisfactory.
9. Commit the results, update documentation, and move to the next stage.

- For prototyping, implementation, and testing, this workflow is applied to each major feature individually. Features are integrated and revisited as needed to accommodate design changes or new requirements.

Each stage will include:
- A detailed action plan document
- A report on changes made
- A checklist to ensure all criteria are met

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation
- **Scope Creep:** Stay focused on feature parity and extensibility. Avoid over-architecting or adding unnecessary complexity.
- **Loss of Legacy Knowledge:** Document all findings and decisions. Migrate data and features carefully.
- **Technical Debt:** Refactor iteratively and document rationale for design choices.

## Success Criteria
- Achieve feature parity with the original game (using legacy or ported data).
- The new system is easy to extend, modify, and onboard new developers.
- Documentation and code reviews confirm alignment with project goals.

## Timeline & Flexibility
- No fixed timeline; priorities and plans will evolve as the project progresses.
- Iterative, feedback-driven approach to ensure quality and alignment with goals.

## Communication & Documentation
- All progress, plans, and changes are documented in `.ai/projects/migrate` and relevant summary docs.
- Each stage includes a code review and documentation update before and after implementation.
- Each stage is divided into:
  - Detailed action plan
  - Change report
  - Completion checklist

This plan will evolve as the project continues. Revisit and update as needed to ensure continued alignment with the overall vision and goals.
