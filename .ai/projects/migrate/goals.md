# Code Migration Project Outline

## Purpose & Goals
Migrate the legacy MUD codebase from C++ to Python, achieving feature parity while improving extensibility, maintainability, and developer onboarding. The new codebase should support modern development practices and be easy to extend and modify.

## Major Phases & Deliverables
1. **Preparation**
   - Review documentation and migration plan from the documentation generation project.
   - Deliverables: Confirmed migration plan, updated file inventories.
2. **Prototyping, Implementation, and Testing (Per-Feature Basis)**
   - Migrate and implement each major feature (e.g., core IO, UI, world loading, inventory, combat, skills, spells, etc.) one at a time.
   - For each feature:
     - Prototype and validate design decisions.
     - Implement and test the feature in Python.
     - Integrate with other features and update as needed.
   - Deliverables: Feature-specific Python code, tests, and documentation; integration reports as needed.
3. **Integration & Validation**
   - Integrate all features and ensure the system achieves feature parity with the original game.
   - Deliverables: Integrated codebase, system tests, user feedback, and final documentation.

## Workflow & Iteration
- Each feature follows a review, Q/A, action plan, execution, and documentation update cycle.
- All findings, decisions, and changes are documented in `.ai/projects/migrate` and relevant summary docs.

## Success Criteria
- The new Python codebase achieves feature parity with the original game.
- The system is easy to extend, modify, and onboard new developers.
- Documentation and code reviews confirm alignment with project goals.
