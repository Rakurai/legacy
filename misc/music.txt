MetallicA~
Of Wolf and Man~
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt, therefore I am, harvest the land, taking of the fallen lamb
Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift, pulsing with the Earth, company we keep,
Roaming the land while you sleep
Shape shift!	  - Nose to the wind!
Shape shift!	  - Feeling I've been!
Move swift!	  - All senses clean!
Earth's gift!     - Back to the meaning-back to the meaning of... LIFE!
Bright is the moon high in starlight
Chill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild, fear in your eyes, it's later than you realized
Shape shift!	  - Nose to the wind!
Shape shift!	  - Feeling I've been!
Move swift!	  - All senses clean!
Earth's gift!     - Back to the meaning-back to the meaning of... LIFE!
...I feel a change...
Back to a better day....
Shape shift! Hair stands on the back of my neck
Shape shift! In wildness is the preservation of the world
-So seek the wolf in thyself!!!
Shape shift!	  - Nose to the wind!
Shape shift!	  - Feeling I have been!
Move swift!	  - All senses clean!
Earth's gift!     - Back to the meaning-back to the meaning.. of wolf, and man!

The Thanksgiving Song~
Love to eat turkey
Love to eat turkey
Love to eat turkey
'Cause it's good
Love to east turkey
Like a good boy should
'Cause it's turkey to eat
'So good
Turkey for me
Turkey for you
Let's eat the turkey
in my big brown shoe
Love to eat the turkey
At the table
With Betty Grable
Eat the turkey
All night long
Fifty million Elvis fans
Can't be wrong
Turkey turkey doo and
Turkey turkey dap
I eat that turkey Then I take a nap
Thanksgiving is a special night
Jimmy Walker used to say Dynamite
That's Right
Turkey with gravy and cranberry
Can't believe the Mets traded Darryl Strawberry
Turkey for you and
Turkey for me
Can't believe Tyson
Gave that girl V.D.
White meat, dark meat
You just can't lose
I fell of my moped
And I got a bruise
Turkey in the oven
I'll never take down
My Cheryl Tiegs poster
Wrap the turkey up

In aluminum foil
My brother like to masturbate
With baby oil
Turkey and sweet potato pie
Sammy Davis Jr.
Only had one eye
Turkey for the girls and
Turkey for the boys
My favorite kind of pants
Are corduroys
Gobble gobble goo and
Gobble gobble gickel
I wish turkey
Only cost a nickel
Oh I love turkey on Thanksgiving
~
Diane Warren, sung by Trisha Yearwood~
How Do I Live~
How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kind of life would that be
Oh and I,
I need you in my arms need you to hold
You're my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything good in my life
Without you there'd be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby, you would take away everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything, need you with me
Baby 'cause you know that you're everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live.
How do I live without you Baby.
How do I live....

Twain/Lange, sung by Shania~
You're Still The One~
When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love.
And after all this time, you're still the one I love.)
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together, still going strong.
You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
Ain't nothin' better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, "I bet they'll never make it"
But just look at us holding on
We're still together still going strong.
You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
You're still the one
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss good night
I'm so glad we made it
Look how far we've come my baby.

Twain/Lange, sung by Shania~
From This Moment On~
I do swear, that I'll always be there
I'd give anything and everything
And I will always care
Through weakness and strength,
Happiness and sorrow,
For better for worse,
I will love you
With every beat of my heart.
From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment I have been blessed
I live only for your happiness
And for your love I'd give my last breath
From this moment on
I give my hand to you with all my heart
Can't wait to live my life with you,
Can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment on
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing I wouldn't give
From this moment
I will love you as long as I live
From this moment on.

Imagine~
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

I Still Haven't Found What I'm...~
I have climbed the highest mountains
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
Only to be with you
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for.
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire
This burning desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm as the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
But yes I'm still running
You broke the bonds
You loosed the chains
You carried the cross
And my shame
And my shame
You know I believe it
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for
But I still haven't found
What I'm looking for

With or Without You~
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Slight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait....without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied
My body bruised, she's got me with
Nothing left to win
And nothing else to lose
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you

I'm Not Strong Enough To Say No~
The sign says "Do not touch, you're outta bounds
You're forbidden fruit, don't come around"
It says don't make plans 'cause on your hand
Is a promise made to another man
Cause when you're around, my defenses go down
Feelings get stronger, looks get longer
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, Just ain't happened yet
So please, please, please go, I'm not strong enough to say no
Please, please don't stay, I'm not man enough to walk away
Please, please pass by, I can't resist you even though I try
So please go, I'm not strong enough to say no
The sign says "Slow down, Slippery Ice"
You've got dangerous curves, don't think twice
It says "Not for sale, you're spoken for"
Just take your heart and walk out the door
Cause when you're around, my defenses go down
Feelings get stronger, looks get longer
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, Just ain't happened yet
So please, please, please go, I'm not strong enough to say no
Please, please don't stay, I'm not man enough to walk away
Please, please pass by, I can't resist you even though I try
So please go, I'm not strong enough to say no
Don't say I didn't warn you, Don't say you didn't know
Don't wait till it's too late, then try to go
The closer you come, the weaker I get
If it ain't happened now, Just ain't happened yet

Goodbye Says It All~
It's another back-door Sneakin'in, Where ya been? Midnight
Quiet as a mack truck-lotsa luck, Thinkin' up an alibi
But every light in the house is on, Everything is gone
She left me no chance at redemption, No further exemption
Just a big red "Goodbye" in lipstick on the wall, Goodbye says it all
No long explanation, No reconciliation, No let's-talk-it-over number I can call
Goodbye says it all, Goodbye......
She coulda thrown a knock-down, scream-and-shout, have-it-out tirade
She coulda made it real tough bringin up all the hell I raised
But no more wasted words on me, No, she kept it short and sweet
She left me no chance at redemption, No further exemption
Just a big red "Goodbye" in lipstick on the wall, Goodbye says it all
No long explanation, No reconciliation, No let's-talk-it-over number I can call
Goodbye says it all, Goodbye......

Big Wheels in the Moonlight~
I came from a town that was so small
You look both ways you could see it all
All I wanted was some way out
Every evening I'd slip into town
And stand around by the caution light
And watch the big trucks rolling by
To me it was a beautiful sight
Seein these big wheels in the moonlight
Now I had a case of wanderlust
I'd lie awake with the windows up
Out on highway fifty-nine
I could hear those big ol' diesel's wine
She was rollin' through all the gears
Headin out to who knows where
Fall asleep most every night
Hearing those big wheels in the moonlight
How I got here, It's hard to say
So many things got in the way
Can't complain bout all I got
Kids and a wife and a regular job
But sometimes when I'm sittin there
All alone in my living room chair
Sometimes I close my eyes
And see big wheels in the moonlight

Weird Al~
The Night Santa Went Crazy~
Down in the workshop all the elves were makin' toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, Nearly scared em' half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
>From his beard to his boots he was covered in ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye
Merry Christmas to all, Now you're all gonna DIE!
The night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nick went insane
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal
Something must have finally snapped in his brain
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolf into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an ol' German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Kruger
And he picked up a flame thrower and he barbequed Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, "Tastes just like chicken"
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole
Without steppin in reindeer guts
There's the national guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness news
And a helicopter circlin' around in the sky
And the bullet's are flyin' and the body count's risin'
And everyone's dying to know, Oh Santa why?
My my my my my my.......
You used to be such a jolly guy.....
Yes Virgina, now Santa's doin' time
In a federal prison for his infamous crime
Hey little friend, now don't you cry no more tears
He'll be out with good behavior in 700 more years
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous
And the elves all got jobs working for the Postal Service
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights...
There talkin' bout- The night Santa went crazy
The night St. Nicholas flipped
Broke his back for some milk and cookies
Sounds to me like he was tired of gettin' gypped
~
Creed~
My Own Prison~
A court is in session, a verdict is in.
No appeal on the docket today,
just my own sin.
The walls are cold and pale,
the cage made of steel.
Screams fill the room,
alone I drop and kneel.
Silence now the sound,
My breath the only motion around..
Demons cluttering around,
my face showing no emotion.
Shacked by my sentence,
expecting no return...
Here there is no penance,
my skin begins to burn.
And I said ohhhhhhh, So I held my head up high,
hiding hate that burns inside,
which only fuels their selfish pride.
And I said ohhhhhhh, all held captive, out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one..
I hear a thunder in the distance,
see a vision of a cross..
I feel the pain that was given on that sad day of loss.
A lion roars in the darkness,
only he holds the key.
A light to free me from my burden,
and grand me life eternally..
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head.
No time for mourning, ain't got no time..
And I said ohhhhhhh, So I held my head up high,
hiding hate that burns inside,
which only fuels their selfish pride.
And I said ohhhhhhh, all held captive, out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one..
I cry out to god, seeking only his decision...
Gabriel stands and confirms:
I've created my own prison.
I cry out to god, seeking only his decision...
Gabriel stands and confirms:
I've created my own prison.
And I said ohhhhhhh, So I held my head up high,
hiding hate that burns inside,
which only fuels their selfish pride.
And I said ohhhhhhh, all held captive, out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one..
And I said ohhhhhhh, So I held my head up high,
hiding hate that burns inside,
which only fuels their selfish pride.
I created! I created! I created!
All held captive, out from the sun,
a sun that shines on only some,
we the meek are all in one..
Should have been dead on a Sunday morning, banging my head!
No time for mourning ain't got no time..........

Kenny Rodgers~
The Gambler~
On a warm summers evening, on a train bound for nowhere
I met up with a gambler, we were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns at staring out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us and he began to speak
He said, son I've made a life out of reading people's faces
And knowing what the cards were, by the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin', I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey, I'll give you some advice
So I handed him my bottle, and he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette and asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet, and his face lost all expression
Said, if you're gonna play the game, boy, you gotta learn to play it right
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin', when the dealin's done
Every gambler knows that the secret to survive is
Knowing what to throw away and knowing what to keep
'Cos every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep
And when he finished speakin', he turned back towards the window
Crushed out the cigarette, faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness, the gambler he broke even
But in his final words I found an ace that I could keep
You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
You never count your money, when you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin', when the dealin's done

Ugly Kid Joe~
Cats in the Cradle~
A child arrived just the other day,
came to the world in the usual way,
But there were planes to catch
and bills to pay, he learned to walk while I was away
He was talking before I knew it and as he grew
he said I'm going to be like you Dad,
you know I'm going to be like you.
And the cat's in the cradle,
and the silver spoon, Little Boy Blue,
and the Man in the Moon,
When you coming home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.
My son turned 10 just the other day,
Said thanks for the ball now c'mon let's play
Will you teach me to throw, I said not today,
I've got a lot to do, he said that's ok
And he walked away and he smiled and he said
You know I'm going to be like you, Dad,
you know I'm going to be like you.
And the cat's in the cradle,
and the silver spoon, Little Boy Blue,
and the Man in the Moon,
When you coming home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.
He came from college just the other day,
so much like a man I just had to say,
I'm proud of you, won't you sit for a while
He shook his head and said with a smile,
What I'm feeling like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys
See you later can I have them please.
And the cat's in the cradle,
and the silver spoon, Little Boy Blue,
and the Man in the Moon,
When you coming home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.
I've long since retired and my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
I'd like to see you, if you don't mind
He said I'd love to Dad, if I could find the time
You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu
But it's sure nice talking you Dad, it's been real nice talking to you.
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me.
And the cat's in the cradle,
and the silver spoon, Little Boy Blue,
and the Man in the Moon,
When you coming home son, I don't know when
We'll get together then, you know we'll have a good time then.

Sister Moon~
Sister moon will you be my guide
In your blue blue shadows, I will hide
All good people asleep tonight
I'm all by myself in your silver light
I would gaze at your face the whole night through
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
Lying in a mother's arms
The primal root of a woman's charms
I'm a stranger to the sun
My eyes are too weak
How cold is a heart
When it's warmth that he seeks?
You watch every night, you don't care what I do
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
I'd go out of my mind, but for you
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun
My hunger for her explains everything I've done
To howl at the moon the whole night through
And they really don't care if I do
I'd go out of my mind, but for you

Little Wing~
Well she's walkin,
through the clouds
With a circus mind,
that's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
and fairy tales
That's all she ever thinks about
Is riding with the wind.
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles,
she gives to me free
It's alright, It's alright she says
Take anything,	you want from me, anything
Well she's walkin through the clouds
With a circus mind,
that's running wild
Butterflies and zebras and moonbeams
and fairy tales
All she ever thinks about
Is riding with the wind
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles, she gives to me free
It's alright, It's alright, she says
Take anything, anything, anything, anything

The Kinks~
Don't Forget To Dance~
You look out of your window, into the night
Could be rain, could be snow
But it can't feel as cold as what you're feeling inside
And all of your friends
Are either married, vanished, or just left alone
But that's no reason to just stop living
That's no excuse to just give in
To a sad and lonely heart
Don't forget to dance
No, No, No
Don't forget to smile
Don't forget to dance
No, No, No
Forget it for awhile
Cause darlin, darlin
I betcha danced a good one in your time
And if this were a party
I'd really make sure the next one would be mine
Yes, you with the broken heart
Don't forget to dance
No, No, No
Don't forget to smile
Don't forget to dance
No, No, No
Forget it for awhile
You walk down the street
And all the young punks whistle at you
A nice bit of vogue
Just goes to show
What you can achieve with the right attitude
As you pass them by
They whisper their remarks one to another
And you give them the eye
Even tho you know you could be their mother
You do the thing you love the best
What separates you from the rest
And what you love to do the most
And when they ask me how you dance
I'll say that you danced real close
Don't forget to dance
No, No, No
Don't forget to dance

Nothing Else Matters~
So close no matter how far,
Couldn't be much more from the heart..
Forever trusting who we are..
And nothing else matters...
Never opened myself this way..
Life is ours, we live it our way..
All these words I don't just say,
And nothing else matters...
Trust I seek and I find in you,
Every day for us something new,
Open mind for a different view..
And nothing else matters...
Never cared for what they do!
Never cared for what they know!
But I know!
So close no matter how far..
Couldn't be much more from the heart..
Forever trusting who we are..
And nothing else matters...
Never cared for what they do!
Never cared for what they know!
But I know!
Never opened myself this way..
Life is ours, we live it our way..
All these words I don't just say,
And nothing else matters...
Trust I seek and I find in you,
Every day for us something new,
Open mind for a different view..
And nothing else matters...
Never cared for what they say!
Never cared for games they play!
Never cared for what they do!
Never cared for what they know!
And I know!  YEAH!
So close no matter how far,
Couldn't be much more from the heart..
Forever trusting who we are..
No nothing else matters...

Possession~
Listen as the wind blows
From across the great divide.
Voices trapped in yearning...
Memories trapped in time..
The night is my companion
and solitude my guide.
Would I spend forever here
and not be satisfied..
And I would be the one....
to hold you down...
kiss you so hard...
I'll take your breath away.
And after I'd wipe away the tears...
just close your eyes dear...
Through this world I've stumbled,
so many times betrayed.
Trying to find an honest word
to find the truth enslaved.
You speak to me in riddles
You speak to me in rhymes....
My body aches to breathe your breath..
your words keep me alive...
And I would be the one...
to hold you down....
kiss you so hard....
I'll take your breath away
And after I'd wipe away the tears
just close your eyes, dear....
Into this night I wander....
It's morning that I dread.
Another day not knowing of...
the path I fear to tread....
Oh Into the sea of waking dreams...
I follow without pride...
Nothing stands between us here...
And I won't be denied.
And I would be the one....
to hold you down...
Kiss you so hard...
I'd take your breath away
And after I'd wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes.......

Unchained Melody~
Oh...my love, my darlin,
I've hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time.
As time goes by so slowly,
that time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love,
I need your love,
God speed your love to me.
Lonely rivers flow
to the sea, to the sea.
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Oh...my love,  my darlin,
I've hungered,
hungered for your touch
a long, lonely time.
And I know that time
goes by so slowly
that time can do so much.
Are you still mine?
I need your love,
I need your love,
God speed your love to me.

The Unforgiven~
New blood joins this earth,
and quickly he's subdued.
Through constant pained disgrace
the young boy learns their rules...
With time the child draws in,
this whipping boy done wrong.
Deprived of all his thoughts,
the young man struggles on and on he's known...
A vow unto his own, that never from this day
his will they'll take away...
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
{bSo I dub thee {cUnforgiven{b.{x
They dedicate their lives
to running all of his,
He tries to please them all,
this bitter man he is.
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly..
This fight he cannot win,
the tired man they see no longer cares..
The old man then prepares... To die regretfully,
That old man here is me...
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me

Mad Jack~
Now this is a story
I swear it's true
All about Mad Jack 
And Argungu
Mad Jack was nobody's fool
Sittin' in back 'n' keepin' cool
The kids ran out as Jack passed by
Throwin' mints with a twinkle in his eye
Keep on truckin'
Riding on thru'
Keep on heading Argungu
Kept his wheels
An' he kept his head
Kept his tiger black white and red
Black white and red
That's what I said
He kept his tiger
Black white and red
The crowds all cheered 
At his strange machine
Flashing thru' the bush
With his racing team
With his map and his tiger in the back
Argungu Jack was the first one back
Keep on truckin' 
Riding on thru'
Keep on heading Argungu
Kept his wheels 
An' he kept his head
Kept his tiger black white and red
Black white and red
That's what I said
He kept his tiger 
Black white and red
Now I'll tell the tale
It really is true
All about Mad Jack 
And Argungu
Four days three nights
Thru' bush and trees
Thru' desert sands
Boulders and rocks
Mad Jack and his crew
Beat the lot
To Argungu
The Flying Dutchman
The Flying Scot
And Snod Goblin eighteen
Tried all they'd got
Making way for no one
They just had to win
To beat Mad Jack 
His friends and crew
And be the first
To Argungu
Thirteen vehicles died
The very first day
And a poor old donkey
Flew away
And an eagle
And umpteen goats
And various quadrupeds 
Met their match
Meeting man made metal monsters
It just didn't do
They couldn't beat Jack 
To Argungu
Bomber Bombadini
Went backwards up a tree
How he got there
Is a mystery to me
The Flying Dutchman
The Scot and eighteen
Got stuck in the sand
And when they got free
Went three ways thru' a village
Chasing me
To Argungu
Thru's the hot and hazy Hamatan
And the cold and windy nights
The remaining few madmen
Blazed there lights
And I lost a wheel
I would've won too
But where the others had failed 
Mad Jack he came thru'
He kept his wheels 
And he kept his head
And he kept his tiger
Black white and red
And to my great surprise
Mad Jack and his crew
Took the prize
At Argungu
The tiger
As it happens
Was a lion

King Crimson~
In The Court Of The Crimson King~
The rusted chains of prison moons
Are shattered by the sun
I walk a road horizons change 
The tournament's begun
The purple piper plays his tune
The choir softly sing
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue
For the court of the Crimson King
The keeper of the city keys
Put shutters on the dreams
I wait outside the pilgrim's door
With insufficient schemes
The black queen chants 
The funeral march
The cracked brass bells will ring
To summon back the fire witch
To the court of the Crimson King
The Gardener plants an evergreen
Whilst trampling on a flower
I chase the wind of a prism ship
To taste the sweet and sour
The pattern juggler lifts his hand
The orchestra begin
As slowly turns the grinding wheel
In the court of the Crimson King
On soft gray mornings widows cry
The wise men share a joke
I run to grasp divining signs
To satisfy the hoax
The yellow jester does not play
But gently pulls the strings
And smiles as the puppets dance
In the court of the Crimson King

Killer~
So you live at the bottom of the sea
and you kill all that come near you
but you are very lonely 
because all the other fish fear you
And you crave companionship and someone to call your own
Because for the whole of your life you've been living alone
On a black day in a black month
at the black bottom of the sea
Your mother gave birth to you
and died immediately
'Cos you can't have two killers in the same pad
and when your mother knew that her time had come
she was really rather glad
Death in the sea Death in the sea
somebody please come and help me, come and help me
Fishes can't fly Fishes can't fly
Fishes can't and neither can I, neither can I
Now Now I'm really rather like you
for I've killed all the love I ever had
by not doing all I ought to
and by leaving my mind coming bad
And I too am a killer
for emotion runs as deep as flesh
and I too and so lonely
and I wish that I could forget

Dinosaur~
Long ago and far away in a different age
When I was a dumb young guy
Fossilized photos of my life then
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been
Standing in the sun
Idiot Savant
Something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
Ignorance has always been something I excel in
Followed by naivete and pride
Doesn't take a scientist to see how
Any clever predator could have a piece of me
Standing in the sun
Idiot Savant
Something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
When I look back on the past
It's a wonder I'm not extinct yet
All the mistakes and bad judgments I made
Nearly pushed me to the brink
It doesn't pay to be too nice
It's one thing I have learned
Still, I made my fossil bed
Now I toss and turn
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones

Oh! Baron Saturday

He bends his mouth up to your ear

He'll take your eyes out for a ride
Through an eyeglass of tears it's not clear
Oh! Baron Saturday
White visions black, Mister Malady
'Neath a sky of milk
You're drinking silk
You've lost the runcible spoon
On satin plates 
Young maidens wait
To be devoured in the glare of the moon
Baron Saturday
Except for Baron Saturday
Your life was cool
Good senses rule
Throw your life away
Oh! Baron Saturday
Let him steal your mind away
He'll show you the grave
Of someone who was saved 
From living her life in a year
He'll show you the grave
Of someone who was saved
From taking his life with a knife
Except for Baron Saturday
Your life was cool
Good sense rule
Throw your life away

In The Name Of Rock And Roll~
Playing in a band who don't understand where the time goes
Asleep on your feet in front of a crowd wearing strange clothes
In the name of rock and roll
In the name of rock and roll
If you're gonna play guitar play it like you're gonna cry
If you're gonna play the drums play them like you're gonna die
I leaned back on my bass guitar 
And dreamed of the day I'm gonna be a star
Playing in a band who don't understand where the time goes
In the name of rock and roll
In the name of rock and roll
What'cha gonna do when the ruins start rolling over you
And the woman you live with has left you to the mercy of the law
And those fairground freaks ooh they try to freeze you out
And you feel so low you can't even reach for the floor
You can take what you want
You can take what you need
You can take my dressing room star
Please don't take me Fender guitar
In the name of rock and roll
Don't take my Fender Guitar
In the name of rock and roll
Playing in a band who don't understand where the time goes
Asleep on your feet in front of a crowd wearing strange clothes
In the name of rock and roll
In the name of rock and roll
Play another song just like the one before
Lay it on strong if you're gonna lay it on at all
But I leaned back and I'm cruising slow
Dreaming of the time I could let it go
Playing in a band who don't understand where the time goes
In the name of rock and roll
In the name of rock and roll

Too Old To Rock And Roll Too Young To Die~
The old rocker wore his hair too long
Wore his trouser cuffs too tight
Unfashionable to the end 
Drank his ale too light
Death's head belt buckle
Yesterday's dreams
The transport caf' prophet of doom
Ringing no change in his
Double sewn seams in his 
Post-war-babe gloom
Now he's too old 
To rock and roll
but he's too young to die
Yes he's too old
To rock and roll
but he's too young to die
He once owned a Harley Davidson
And a Triumph Boniville
Counted his friends in
Burned out spaark plugs
Prayed that he always will
But he's the last of the blue blood
Greaser boys
All his mates are doing time
Or married with three kids
Up by the ring road
Sold their souls straight down the line
And some of them own
Little sports cars
And meet at the tennis club do's
For drinks on a Sunday
Work on Monday
They've thrown away there Blue Suede shoes
Now they're too old
To rock and roll
But they're too young to die
Yes they're too old 
To rock and roll
But they're too young to die
So the old rocker
Gets out his bike
To make a ton before he takes his leave
Upon the A1
By Scotch Corner
Just like it used to be
And as he flies
Tears in his eyes
His wind whipped word echo the final take
As he hits the trunk road
doing around 120
with no room left to brake
And he was too old 
To rock and roll
And he was too young to die
Yes he was too old 
To rock and roll
And he was too young to die
No your never too old
To rock and roll
If your too young to die
No your never too old
To rock and roll
But he was toooooo young too
Diiiiiieeee

Uriah Heep~
Lady in Black~
She came to me one morning
One lonely Sunday morning
Her long hair flowing in the midwinter wind
I know not how she found me
For in darkness I was walking
And destruction lay around me 
From a fight I could not win
She asked me name my foe then
I said the need within some men
To fight and kill their brothers
Without thought of love or God
And I begged her give me horses
To trample down my enemies
So eager was my passion
To devour this waste of life
But she would not think of battle that
Reduces men to animals
So easy to begin 
And yet impossible to end
For she's the mother of our men
Who councelled me so wisely then
I feared to walk alone again 
And asked if she would stay
Oh lady lend your hand outright
And let me rest here at your side
Have faith and trust in me she said
And filled my heart with life
There is no strength in numbers
Have no such misconception
But when you need me
Be assured I won't be far away
Thus having spoke she turned away
And though I found no words to say
I stood and watched until I saw
Her black coat disappear
My labour is no easier
But now I know I'm not alone
Ill find new heart
Each time I think upon that windy day
And if one day she comes to you
Drink deeply from her words so wise
Take courage from her as your prize
And say hello for me

All I Want~
I'll ruin my life for you. As long as I know,
That I'm the only one.
That phrase runs through my mind, each and every day
What happened to that love?  Is it still there?
Or did it fade away?  All I wanna do is hold you.
Kiss your lips, Or look into your eyes.
To have you holding me, Or kissing me,
Or looking into my eyes, would mean more than anything.
I know you're leaving soon, You'll be far and far away
But I know our love is strong enough, To endure such pain
And all I can say is: All I wanna do is hold you,
Kiss your lips, Or look into your eyes
To have you holding me, kissing me,
Or looking into my eyes, would mean more than anything.
All I wanna do is hold you, Kiss your lips
Or look into your eyes.  I'll ruin my life for you
As long as I know, That I'm the only one.....

It's Your Love~
Dancing in the dark
middle of the night
takin' your heart
and holding it tight
Emotional touch
touchin' my skin
and askin' you to do
what you been doin' all over again
Oh it's a beautiful thing
don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
what it is that won't let me go
It's your love
just does somethin' to me
it sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
bout' the spell I'm under
it's your love
Better then I was
more than I am
and all of this happened
by takin' your hand
And who I am now
is who I wanted to be
and now that we're together
I'm stronger than ever I'm happy and free
Oh it's a beautiful thing
don't think I can keep it all in
and if you ask me why I changed
all I gotta do is say your sweet name
It's your love
just does somethin' to me
it sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
And if you wonder
bout' the spell I'm under
It's your love
Ohh it's a beautiful thing
Don't think I can keep it all in
I just gotta let you know
What it is that won't let me go
It's your love
just does somethin' to me
it sends a shock right through me
I can't get enough
and if you womder
bout' the spell I'm under
It's your love
It's your love
It's your love

Butterfly~
Once upon a time in a strange and far off land
A butterfly came down, and lit upon my hand
Its colors were so beautiful as it graced me with its touch
I wished that it could stay forever, but I knew I asked too much
Butterfly
Please won't you stay
I cannot ask you anything, so silently I pray
That the day will never come when you feel you have to leave
For though no emotion I will show, my heart will break and grieve
I stand as still as possible, with my palm open wide
For I know that to move an inch, is to force you from my side
I stare into your grace and beauty, my desire hotter burns
I give you all my care and love, and ask nothing in return
Butterfly
Please won't you stay
I cannot ask you anything, so silently I pray
That the day will never come when you feel you have to leave
For though no emotion I will show, my heart will break and grieve
I understand the time is here and I hope you see it too
I'd wished this day would never come, but I sadly see it's true
I raise my hand up high, you take wing and fly away
Looking up I wish upon a star that you'll be back someday
Butterfly
Please won't you stay
I cannot ask you anything, so silently I pray
That the day will never come when you feel you have to leave
For though no emotion I will show, my heart will break and grieve
For though no emotion I will show, my heart will break and bleed.

Release~
I want the world to wake
I want to give you peace
I want to vindicate
You need to be released
Don't wanna hurt you..
I need to make you see
If I desert you...
It's just to make you see
That I'm a man that's weak..
And I'm a man that's lost..
I gave it all away..
To complicate the cost
Don't wanna hurt you..
I need to make you see
If I desert you...
It's just to make you see
Not gonna hurt you now...
I need to make you see
If I desert you now...
It's just to make you see
I want you to be free..
I want you to be free from me
I want you to be free..
I want you to be free from me
I want you to be free..
I want you to be free from me
I want you to be free..
I want you to be free from me
yeah.....

You Were Mine~
I can't find the reason, to let go
Even though you found a new love
And she's what your dreams are made of
I can find a reason, to hang on
What when a wrong can be forgiven
Without you it ain't worth livin', alone
Sometimes I wake up, crying at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take you away
When for so long you were mine
Took out all the pictures of our wedding day
It was a time of love and laughter
Happy ever after
But even those old pictures, have begun to fade
Please tell me she's not real
That your really comin' home to stay
Sometimes I wake up, crying at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine
I can give you two good reasons
To show you love's not blind
He's two and she's four, and you know they adore you
So how can I tell then, you changed your mind
Sometimes I wake up, crying at night
And sometimes I scream out your name
What right does she have to take your heart away
When for so long you were mine
I remember when you were mine

You Can't Lose Me~
A little girl, a little small for her age
A little too slow for the field day race
Momma's waiting at the finish line.....
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes
She says, "You did just fine honey, that's okay
Sometimes life's just that way
You're gonna lose the race from time to time
But you're always gonna find.......
You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be....
just a wish away....
Wherever you go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe........
You can't lose me."
Momma used to say, "Girl it won't be long
'Til it's time to go out on your own.
Chase your dreams, find your place in life
I know you'll do just fine"
When that day finally came
There were things she needed to but could not say
So I whispered softly as I wiped
The tears from her eyes.....
You can't lose me
Bet your life
I am here and I will always be
Just a wish away
Wherever I go
No matter how far
My love is where you are
You won't be lost if you believe
You can't lose me.

Perry Mason~
On his way to dinner, when it took him by surprise
And with one pull of the trigger, he would vanish overnight
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life
Then a gun from out of nowhere, made a widow of his wife
I don't mind..
Single file down the runway
Feeling fine..
And I'll see you my friend, over and over again!
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason!
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason!
Again....
Again...
Riding painted horses, oh the kids they love it so
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow
Minding my own business, like my momma always said
But if I don't try to help 'em, they could wind up on the front page..
I dont mind..
Draw the line --then draw me an arrow
Feelin' fine..
Then I'll see you my friend, over and over again!
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason!
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason!
Again....
Again...
Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right
Just keep on talking baby, I've been doing this all night
..How much did you give me? Tell me it'll be all right
Who can we get on the case?
We need Perry Mason!
Someone to put you in place
Calling Perry Mason!
Again....
Again...
Again....
Again.......

Head Over Feet~
I had no choice but to hear you
You stated your case time and again
I thought about it
You treat me like I'm a princess
I'm not used to liking that
You ask how my day was
You've already won me over in spite of me
Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
Your love is thick and it swallowed me whole
You're so much braver than I gave you credit for
That's not lip service
You've already won me over in spite of me
Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
You are the bearer of unconditional things
You held your breath and the door for me
Thanks for your patience
You're the best listener that I've ever met
You're my best friend
Best friend with benefits
What took me so long
I've never felt this healthy before
I've never wanted something rational
I am aware now, I am aware now
You've already won me over in spite of me
Don't be alarmed if I fall head over feet
Don't be surprised if I love you for all that you are
I couldn't help it
It's all your fault
~
Shania Twain~
You're still the one~
When I first saw you 
I saw love
And the first time you touched me
I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We might of took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday
They said, I bet, they'll never make it
But just look at us holdin on
We're still together, still goin' strong
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
Ain't nothin better
We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen
Look at what we would be missin'
They said, I bet, they'll never make it
But just look at us holdin' on
We're still together, still goin' strong
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
You're still the one I run to
The one that I belong to
You're still the one I want for life
You're still the one that I love
The only one I dream of
You're still the one I kiss goodnight
I'm so glad we made it, look how far we've come my baby

Bobcaygeon~
I left your house this morning,
About a quarter after nine
Could have been the Willie Nelson,
Coulda been the wine
When I left your house this morning, was a little after nine..
It was in Bobcaygeon I saw the constellations
Reveal themselves, one star at a time
Drove back to town this morning
With working on my mind
I thought I may be quitting
Thought of leaving it behind
Went back to bed this morning, and as I'm pulling down the blind
Yeah the sky was dull, and hypothetical, and falling one cloud at a time
That night in Toronto, with it's checkerboard floors
Riding on horseback, and keeping order restored
Til the men they couldn't hang, stepped to the mic and sang,
And their voices rang, with that Aryan twang.....
....I got to your house this morning
Just a little after nine
In the middle of that riot,
Couldn't get you off my mind
So I'm at your house this morning, just a little after nine
Cause it was in Bobcaygeon, where I saw the constellations,
Reveal themselves one star at a time.....

Killing Time~
You were the first thing that I thought of
When I thought I drank you off my mind
When I get lost in the liquor
You're the only one I'd find
And if I did the things I oughta'
You still would not be mine
So I keep a tight grip on the bottle
Getting loose, and killin' time
This killin' time, is killin' me
Drinkin' myself blind, thinkin' I won't see
That if I cross that line, and they bury me
Well I just might find I'll be killin time
For eternity
I don't know nuthin bout tomorrow
I been lost in yesterday
Spent all my time just dying for
A love that passed away
But there's an end to all my sorrow
And It's the only price I'll pay
I'll be a happy man when I go
And I can't wait another day
This killin' time, is killin' me
Drinkin' myself blind, thinkin' I won't see
That if I cross that line, and they bury me
Well I just might find I'll be killin time
For eternity........

Hurt~
I... hurt myself today...
To see if I still feel
I... focus on the pain...
The only thing that's real...
The needle tears a hole...
The old familiar sting
Try to kill it all away..
But I remember.. everything...
What have I become...?
My sweetest friend...
Everyone I know.. goes away.. in the end...
You could have it all
My empire of dirt
I will let you down
I will make you hurt
..I wear this crown of (*bleep*)...
Upon my liar's chair...
Full of broken thoughts...
I cannot repair...
Beneath the stains of time...
The feelings disappear...
You are someone else...
I am still right here.
What have I become...?
My sweetest friend...
Everyone I know.. goes away.. in the end...
And you could have it all,
My empire of dirt!
I will *let* you down,
I will make you hurt!
If I could start again...
A million miles away...
I would keep myself...
I WOULD FIND A WAY...

The Line~
They say that getting there is half the fun
So being there is the rest
Pacing myself to win this race
Is gonna put me to the test
I'm askin: Where do I go, How will I know
Does anyone have the time
To tell me dark or light
Left or right, Where do I find the line
The line running down the middle
The balance in all things
Do I walk and enjoy the scenery
Or get there fast on my wings...
There's a purpose and place for everything
And for everything there's a time
There's a delicate balance between the extremes
And we all must look for the line
The love that I've lived my life for
Where does it fit in my plans
And while I'm sitting here wondering what to do
Is it slipping away through my hands
So tell me: Where do I go, How will I know
Does anyone have the time
To tell me dark or light
Left or right, Where do I find the line
The line running down the middle
The balance in all things
Do I walk and enjoy the scenery
Or get there fast on my wings...
Although I look for the beauty in all things
I have often wished I were blind
If I could open my eyes and see it all
I wonder what beauty I'd find
They say that this life will give and take
And what you don't need leave behind
For the things I own are hard to hold
And the things I hold are not mine
I'm askin: Where do I go, How will I know
Does anyone have the time
To tell me dark or light
Left or right, Where do I find the line
The line running down the middle
The balance in all things
Do I walk and enjoy the scenery
Or get there fast on my wings...
There's a purpose and place for everything
And for everything there's a time
There's a delicate balance between the extremes
And we all must look for the line
So tell me where do I find the line.....

Running Bear~
On the banks of the river stood Runnin' Bear, young Indian brave.
On the other side of the river stood his lovely Indian maid.
Little White Dove was-a her name, such a lovely sight to see...
But their tribes fought with each other so their love could never be.
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love big as the sky.
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love that couldn't die...
He couldn't swim the raging river, 'cause the river was too wide...
He couldn't reach Little White Dove, waiting on the other side.
In the moonlight he could see her blowing kisses, 'cross the waves...
Her little heart was beating faster, waiting there for her brave.
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love big as the sky
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love that couldn't die...
Runnin' Bear dove in the water, Little White Dove did the same
and they swam out to each other through the swirling stream they came.
As their hands touched and their lips met, the raging river pulled them down.
Now they'll always be together in that happy hunting ground
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love big as the sky.
Runnin' Bear loved Little White Dove with a love that couldn't die...

The Way You Make Me Feel~
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like Ive never ever known
Youre just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
Ill pick you up in my car
And well paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That youre the one for me
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
I like this feeling youre giving me
Just hold me, baby, and Im in ecstasy
Oh, Ill be working from 9 to 5
To buy you things, To keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, youll love me forever more
I swear Im keeping you satisfied
Cause youre the one for me
The way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet, now baby (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)
I never felt so in love before
Promise, baby, youll love me for ever more
I swear Im keepin you satisfied
Cause youre the one for me
Way you make me feel (The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet, now baby (You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (My lonely days are gone)

Emotion~
It's over and done
but the heartache lives on inside
And who's the one you're clinging to
instead of me tonight?
And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean
You never see me fall apart
In the words of a broken heart
It's just emotion that's taken me over
Caught up in sorrow, lost in my soul
But if you don't come back
Come home to me, darling
Dont you know there's nobody left in this world
to hold me tight
Dont cha know there's nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight
I'm there at your side,
I'm part of all the things you are
But you've got a part of someone else
You've got to find your shining star
And where are you now, now that I need you?
Tears on my pillow wherever you go
I'll cry me a river that leads to your ocean

My Sacrifice~
Hello my friend, we meet again
It's been awhile, where should we begin?
Feels like forever
Within my heart a memory
A perfect love that you gave to me
Oh, I remember
When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My Sacrifice
We've seen our share of ups and downs
Oh how quickly life can turn around
In an instant
It feels so good to realize
What's in yourself and within your mind
Let's find peace there
When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My Sacrifice
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
When you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
Cause when you are with me, I'm free
I'm careless, I believe
Above all the others, we'll fly
This brings tears to my eyes
My Sacrifice, My Sacrifice
I just want to say hello again
I just want to say hello again
My Sacrifice

I Walk Alone~
I can't take this anymore, and I'm almost pretty sure
I've been here before
I can't take this any longer, I won't heal until I'm stronger
strong enough to not be afraid
of what anybody thinks, of what anybody says
about the way, about the way I am
I'll wait until the day, when those feelings fade away
then I'll make my break...
I can't take this anymore, and I'm almost pretty sure
I've been here before
I can't take this any longer, I won't heal until I'm stronger
strong enough to not be afraid
I leave it up to you, yeah I leave it in your hands
respect your wishes, and your demands
but if it was up to me, honey we'd already be
back at home and
liiiiviiiing ouuuut ouuuur dreeeeeams
liiiiviiiing ouuuut...
everbody, and everything I've known
never taught me how to stand up on my own
had to learn it from the one who let me go
now I walk alone
yeah, I walk alone
liiiiviiiing bliiiissfuuulllly
I guess you had to step away, to make me want to be
a bigger man, a bigger man than that
I need you by my side, as I take it all in stride
I put away, I put away my pride
oh, I leave it up to you
yeah, I leave it in your hands
respect your wishes, and your demands
but if it was up to me
honey we'd already be
back at home and
liiiiviiiing ouuuut...
everbody, and everything I've known
never taught me how to stand up on my own
had to learn it from the one who let me go
now I walk alone
yeah, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk, oh yeah...

Mama Said Knock You Out~
Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years
I'm rocking my peers, puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon, listen to the bass go BOOM!
Explosions, overpowerin', over the competition I'm towerin'
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics, that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move, don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced, competition's payin' the price
I'm gonna knock you out! Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
Don't you call this a regular jam, I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm, and I'm just gettin' warm
Just like Muhammed Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull that you know I've beef with
Why do you riff with me - the maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready 'cause I might go Blaw!
How you like me now?  The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift, listen to my gears shift
I'm blasting, I'm blasting, kinda like Shaft, so you can say I'm shafting
Oh, English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme
I'm gonna knock you out! Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH!  I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw, but now I gotta new tour
I'm going insane, startin' the hurricane, releasin' pain
Lettin' you know you can't gain or maintain, unless you say my name
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole, pass the Old Gold
I'm gonna knock you out! Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
Shotgun blasts are heard, when I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand, that I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand... Damn!
Ooh!  Listen to the way I slay... your crew
Damage UH!  Damage UH!  Damage UH!
Damage, destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him
Farmers (what)  Farmers (what)  I'm ready (we're ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town (get down)
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
Cause I explode, and my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God, 'cause he gave me the strength to rock HARD!
I'm gonna knock you out! Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
I'm gonna knock you out, Mama said knock you out!
