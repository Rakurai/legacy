Desc {TStanding amidst onlookers is a {CBard {Tof well-earned reputation. Traveling Thera from an
early time he has an {gageless {Tquality about him while still possessing the rugged good
looks of his youth.  Just stopping to tell of his latest adventure he captures his
audiences with his {cdazzling silver eyes {Tand {Mhypnotizing voice{T. Wisdom and patience
shine in his eyes and you hardly notice he is well armed with the {Hlegendary elven
sword {RD{ce{Rs{ct{Ri{cn{Ry{c'{Rs {cB{Rl{ca{Rd{ce , {Talong with another remarkable weapon forged by the elven smiths
for his use alone. His {Cs{co{Cn{cg {Twas magically bound to the sword making him master of his
own {Wfate{T. Wisps of {csilver {Thighlight his otherwise raven black hair. You move closer
and notice he is taller than first appearances lead on and moves with a grace that
lets no motion he makes go wasted. A {Cs{co{Cn{cg {Tstarts buzzing in your ears and everything
seems to {Nslow {Tto a lingering pace; its rumored he has mastered the {BOcarina of time{T.

{bWith champagne in hand, {Ma story to tell, {Rand hearts to break: {HK{ci{Hs{cm{He{ct {His back in town.{x

cut down the evil Elvanshalee and do honor to their family.  The

Heroes have been known to wax poetic describing the merits of this
powerful armor, although its heavy weight leaves something to be
