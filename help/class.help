{RClerics{x are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells

protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess.

0 THIEF 'THIEF BASICS' 'THIEF DEFAULT'~
{RThieves{x are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class,
but have the widest range of skills available.  {RThieves{x are specialists at
thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where
more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
clerics, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors.

{RWarriors{x live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters
of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical
talents of mages and priests.  {RWarriors{x are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.

as the purbeyors of unremitting evil.

Popular myth tells about {Rnecromancers{x practicing vile and forbidden arts.
He is the macabre sorcerer who roots about in graveyards, searching
out moldering components for his obscene spells.  She is the evil
priestess who calls upon restless, tormented spirits of the long
deceased, seeking their immortal arcana.  In their dark secluded
lairs, the mute undead, the monstrous familiar, and the ravening fiend
serve the necromancers in their ghoulish endeavors.

0 BARDS~

who sand the history of their tribes in long, recitative poems.
These {Rbards{x, found mainly in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland, filled many
important roles in their society.  They were storehouses of tribal
history, reporters of news, messengers, and even ambassadors to other
tribes. Indeed, every culture has its storyteller or poet, whether he is
called a {Rbard{x, or something else.

A {Rbard{x, by his nature, tends to learn many different skills.  He is a jack
of all trades but master of none.  {RBards{x can lighten your day, or can steal
your purse.  They can be treated as friends or enemies.
