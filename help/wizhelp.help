92 HELPFILEernate{x, or '{Calt{x', is a character played by the same person as
another character.  This is allowed, and even encouraged, as part of the
fun is trying out classes and races that you may be unfamiliar with.  Many
players have more than one character, and most try to roleplay them
separately from their other characters.  This too is encouraged, many
find the challenge of roleplaying different characters stimulating.

Roleplay is not forced on {BL{Ce{gg{Wa{Cc{By{x, but this should not be confused with
tolerance of making it difficult to roleplay.  Players work hard to keep
their alts separate, but alas, it is natural to blur the difference
between player and character.  People tend to familiarize themselves with
the player, and in doing so, often fail to treat their characters as
individuals.  Thus, many players do not reveal the identities of all their
characters.

If you know who a player's alts are, do NOT reveal them to others without
express permission from that player.  It is considered rude and extremely
bad etiquette, and is not tolerated on Legacy.  This applies to any form
of communication on the mud, including notes and channels.  {PPunishment{x for
revealing alts is swift and harsh.  Please, respect your fellow players,
don't destroy the possibility of roleplay for others.

forget to tell us how they plan to make their dream real. Every good idea
has a workable plan. You must tell us your plan or suffer from the sad
reality that we cannot read your mind.

Something your application can include:
Flavor/Personality
If you like to roleplay, write the note in character. Nothing is more
pleasing than to have an immortal who has personality. Write in your
accent. Use your mannerisms. We enjoy a good read as much as the next
person. A word of caution though: Do not overwhelm the intent of the paper
with your roleplay. The submission is there to be evaluated on your ability
to contribute to the mud, not how convincingly you can portray a down and
out blacksmith with only one hand and a lisp.

When referring to a {Cspell{x or a {Cgeneric command{x within the text of the

The new Imm Legacy system is for you to be as creative as possible in 
running quests, designing tokens, and making the mud fun for mortals.
However, there are certain rules that must be followed to make the 
system work, and make it fair for everybody.

First of all, tokens are treated just like qp, do not give them out 
unless you have a reason.  Your alt may not touch your imm tokens.  
Let me repeat that again.  {PYOUR ALT MAY NOT TOUCH YOUR IMM TOKENS.{x
This means at no time may your alt have your imm tokens.  Obviously, 
this also means you cannot collect your own legacy set.  Duh!  Also,
using owhere to find tokens is explicitly illegal.  Owhere IS logged,
and using it for your own benefit, or telling others where hidden tokens
are located will result in an almost certain fry.

Likewise, tokens are not to be handed out to friends.  This should be
obvious.  Tokens will be given out for what they are intended for.  
Hiddens will be dropped around the realm randomly, a trivia token given
to a mortal who answers a trivia question of yours right in a trivia 
quest, and quest tokens given out for tag/hug quests, or any other quest
you guys want to do.  These are no brainers.  

When you string your tokens, please load them from the appropriate vnums.
There are separate vnums for hidden, trivia, quest, and wild.  When you
string, your name MUST be in the keywords, the token TYPE (hidden, wild,
whatever) MUST be in the long and the keywords.  Please don't do anything
obscene (another nobrainer), but otherwise use your roleplay and creative
max in designing and coloring!  

Please do not drop more than 25 hidden tokens a day, or give out more than
50 tokens total.  At any time there should be no more than approximately
500 of your tokens in circulation, if I notice that everybody and their 
uncle has 50 of your tokens, it means you are distributing much too many of
them.  Use your common sense, we know you have it, that's why we hired you
as an imm. :)  Make sure you know the mortal helpfile for legacy sets, and
if you have any questions, ask!  
ot follow this help file to the letter. You are
writing a paper that supports your bid for immortality. Our help file tells

served as head of all Administration.  Unfortunately, due to her many
pursuits, she is no longer active on Legacy. 
owed to make the 
system work, and make it fair for everybody.

First of all, tokens are treated just like qp, do not give them out 
unless you have a reason.  Your alt may not touch your imm tokens.  
Let me repeat that again.  {PYOUR ALT MAY NOT TOUCH YOUR IMM TOKENS.{x
This means at no time may your alt have your imm tokens.  Obviously, 
this also means you cannot collect your own legacy set.  Duh!  Also,
using owhere to find tokens is explicitly illegal.  Owhere IS logged,
and using it for your own benefit, or telling others where hidden tokens
are located will result in an almost certain fry.

Likewise, tokens are not to be handed out to friends.  This should be
obvious.  Tokens will be given out for what they are intended for.  
Hiddens will be dropped around the realm randomly, a trivia token given
to a mortal who answers a trivia question of yours right in a trivia 
quest, and quest tokens given out for tag/hug quests, or any other quest
you guys want to do.  These are no brainers.  

When you string your tokens, please load them from the appropriate vnums.
There are separate vnums for hidden, trivia, quest, and wild.  When you
string, your name MUST be in the keywords, the token TYPE (hidden, wild,
whatever) MUST be in the long and the keywords.  Please don't do anything
obscene (another nobrainer), but otherwise use your roleplay and creative
max in designing and coloring!  

Please do not drop more than 25 hidden tokens a day, or give out more than
50 tokens total.  At any time there should be no more than approximately
500 of your tokens in circulation, if I notice that everybody and their 
uncle has 50 of your tokens, it means you are distributing much too many of
them.  Use your common sense, we know you have it, that's why we hired you
as an imm. :)  Make sure you know the mortal helpfile for legacy sets, and
if you have any questions, ask!  
ot follow this help file to the letter. You are
writing a paper that supports your bid for immortality. Our help file tells
you what general topics you need to cover in order to make a good
application. Just because you follow this help does not mean you will be
made an immortal, but it will definitely produce an application that is
more than and better than:

If you have ever played Scrabble and Literati (the online Yahoo! version

putting words together.  She has brought the game to {BL{Ce{gg{Wa{Cc{By{x for you guys
to sharpen your word skills.

{WL{Yi{Cr{Bi{Ca{Yt{Wi {Btiles{x will be periodically scattered around Thera, just like

{Yd{bouble wor{Yd{x, and {Pt{Rriple wor{Pd{x tiles, as well as {Wwilds{x.  The double and
triple letters and words do exactly as they say they do.  You may pick a 
letter to double or triple, or if it's a double or triple word, your
whole words point value gets multiplied.  {WWhite wild {Btiles{x don't count
for points but they can complete that annoying word that is just missing
a single letter.  

When you turn in your {WL{Yi{Cr{Bi{Ca{Yt{Wi{x word, you must turn it in in a special 
{WL{Yi{Cr{Bi{Ca{Yt{Wi {BTile {YHolder{x, which may also be found scattered around the realm.
Based on the total point value of that word, you will be awarded {Bq{Cu{Be{Cs{Bt

you turn in a 20 point word.  You would then get {B10 tokens{x.  And no, you
do not get any tiles or the tile holder back.  Accepted words may not be
proper nouns, abbreviations, prefixes, or suffixes, and will be checked

Trading cards are back!  You can now find these bits of {WM{go{Wn{Ct{Wr{ge{Wy{x's {BL{Cegacy {BS{Cet{x

for those of you who want to know more about the object on the card, just look
at the card to hear about the coolness that made it a legend.  Each one counts
as a single hidden token, except for the ultra-cool {PRARE{x cards that count

But, that's not all!  If you bring to me {Y10{x different cards at once, you get
a special bonus.  I'll autograph them for you and put them in a special
protective binder, and you'll get a free restring token!  Sounds great, right?
Of course it is.  The autographed cards can still be used as part of my set,
of course, so there's no reason not to do it.  But wait!  Could there STILL
be more??  You bet there is.  If one of the {Y10{x cards you bring me is a {Prare{x
