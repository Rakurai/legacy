The {Cpit{x command allows you to look into the donation pit.  Just as with
{Clook in pit{x, you must be standing by the pit in order to see inside.

Syntax examples:
   {Cpit{x           - shows you items around your level.
   {Cpit 15{x        - shows you items around level 15 ( 5 - 25, actually )
   {Cpit 10 20{x     - shows you items between levels 10 and 20.
   {Cpit axe{x       - shows you all items called 'axe' in the pit.
   {Cpit 45 sword{x  - shows you swords in the pit around level 45.
   {Cpit 20 40 axe{x - shows you axes between levels 20 and 40.

not worthy to wield... This is an artifact of the intended purpose, which
is to show who wrote their name in the history of Thera using this weapon.

To engrave a weapon, take it to any jeweler in the game (there are more
than you might have thought) wield it, and '{Pengrave{x <{Yyourmessage{x>'.
Thereafter, if you look at the weapon you will see that there are
'personal {Cengravings{x' on it, and you can '{Plook engravings{x'. If you have
more than one engraved weapon, you can '{Plook 2.engravings{x'. Your
engraving will look like this:

     "<your engraved message>"

So you may want to have your title reflect something about your skill or
intent in making the weapon, as this will be recorded along with your
engraved message.
