0 REBIRTH REMORT REINCARNATIONell as a dangerous fighter, he combines good
combat skills with a few extra abilities that give him many options and
decisions during play.  He boasts the courage and strength of a warrior
and the stealth and self-reliance of a thief.  He combines the druids
affinity for the outdoors with  the devotion and magical aptitude of a
priest.  He's a hunter, tracker, and survivalist.  By temperament and
by choice, he's a loner, often prefering the company of animals to people.
Without question, he's one with nature, sworn to protect the inhabitants of
the wilderness.

{BSyntax: {Ycritical blow{x

One of the ranger's many strengths is his perceptive eye in analyzing
situations, areas, or others.  This skill uses that perception to
look for a weakness in an opponent so that they may mortally wound
them in a single strike.  Even if the blow misses, it does some
damage, and as an opponent gets weaker and weaker, it becomes easier
to critical blow them.
