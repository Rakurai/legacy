make your weapon easier to forge, or more difficult.  Other materials can
make your weapon stronger or weaker.  In addition, forged weapons will

This includes, but is not restricted to, those who sideswipe us or engage us
in warfare. With this in mind, those who do evil are due neither our respect
nor our mercy.  -- only DESTRUCTION. It is no less than the DUTY of all 
{NK{Bn{Ci{Wg{Ch{Bt{Ns of the {NB{Blu{Ne {NR{Bos{Ne{x to reduce such varlets 
to a bit of blood spoor and the fleeting memory of the villain(s)' vile 
existence. If this means that we get a few {RKILLER{x flags, so be it. We 
will defend our clan by any resources of strength, sorcery and stealth that
we can muster. Otherwise, we will be honourable with our opponents, accepting
their surrenders graciously. Individuals who offend us shall be placed onto
the List of the Black Rose; these fallen lot shall be subject to our extreme
ill will and we will take every opportunity to kill them. Redemption shall be
at OUR discretion.

As for honour in METHODS of PK, understand this -- the object of ANY PK
combat, ESPECIALLY during wartime, is to WIN, not posture and moralise. 
Anything goes in PK; whoever says otherwise is lying to themselves. We don't
advocate breaking the rules, but otherwise anything goes. Any trick, tool or
resource at our command shall be used to defend our clan and the innocent in
the most efficient way possible. This is our code of honour, and woe to those
who would impugn it.
