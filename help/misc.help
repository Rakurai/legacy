1 hedit~
{Ycedit{x is a handy tool for creating, deleting, and modifying help
files.  Editing is performed directly on the database, so the changes
are immediate and persistent.  The {Ycedit{x syntax is as follows:

{Y  cedit  {Cnew       {x<keywords>     {T- create a new help and get ID{x
{Y  cedit  {Cdelete    {x<id>           {T- permanently delete a help{x
{Y  cedit  {Cshow      {x<id>           {T- display a help's values{x

{Y  cedit  {Chgroup    {x<id> <value>   {T- change a help's grouping{x
{Y  cedit  {Conum      {x<id> <value>   {T- change a help's relative ordering{x
{Y  cedit  {Clevel     {x<id> <value>   {T- restrict a help to at or above a level{x
{Y  cedit  {Ckeywords  {x<id> <value>   {T- change the keyword list{x
{Y  cedit  {Ctext      {x<id> <value>   {T- set the text of the help{x

Once a help file is created, the {Pedit{x command is a useful tool
for adding text content to the help.  See {Phelp edit{x for details.

Legacy is currently stable.  Some bugs pop up, but we are doing our best
to squash them immediately.  The 'My' in 'MyLegacy' refers to our dependence
on MySQL, a very fast and powerful databasing engine used for increasing
amounts of our information storage and retrieval.

0 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,  
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code. It can
be found on Rehobaom's Legacy, at hypercube.org 9000.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --  Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --  Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --  Seth

Maps and map shop --  Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --  Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --  Alander

Ideas and playtesting --  Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

The New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the
originator of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bugs reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

Bug reports --
    Thanks to Shad Muegge, Jerome Despret, Phoenix, Will Hongach,
    Erwin S. Andreasen, Adam Debus and especially Gary Turkington
    (author of the ROM FAQ) for help spotting bugs

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (the new poofin/poofout), and many contributions
and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's work on
Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

0 BACKGROUND STORY~
Let me sit you down, young traveler, and tell you a tale ...

Long ago, the universe was very different.  Worlds existed only to
themselves, and one such world called as Thera.  It was a thriving
land, and together with its inhabitants, it was the realm known to
all as Dizzy.  Filled with immortals and mortals alike, it thrived
and prospered.  But then one day, it all ended.  Looking back, we can
only guess that another realm had collided with Dizzy, but we still
are not certain.  All we know is that everything as we knew it had
been shattered, and all around us lay the bits and pieces of what was
once our world.  

Somehow, within the utter chaos, a separate, new universe had been
born, and whether by the grace of Lady Luck or Lady Fate, three
individuals stumbled upon it.  They saw what was before their eyes
with crystal clarity, and knew what they had to do.  Slowly, and with
painstaking effort, they took each shard they could find, and shaped
it, melding them together to create a crude imitation of what they
had known before.  

But it was not enough.  For when they finished and glanced around
themselves, only then did they begin to see the potential.  The earth
was new, undisturbed.  The air was fresh, clean.  All around them lay 
silence, but it was not unwelcome.  There was so much that could be.
And so they started anew, breaking apart what they had just made, and
reshaping, creating, drawing upon magicks and energy that even they
did not know existed, until they had tried.  At the end, when it was
finished, all three were exhausted.  But they looked around them, saw
the joy, anguish, love, pain, and happiness that would take place 
in what they had created, and it was worth it.

Slowly, travelers started trickling in, and finding the peaceful, 
open atmosphere to their liking, settled down and stayed.  Many more
came, curious as to this realm where fantasy was reality, where the
world was built into a whole, where mortals and immortals appreciated 
alike, and where each and every traveler such as you will find
something to captivate their interest and might adventure, explore,
or just rest one's weary heart for a while.

0 RULE RULES~
{gThe {BRules {gof {BL{Ce{Wg{ga{Cc{By{x

These are the rules of Legacy.  They are here to ensure that this mud is
fair and enjoyable for everybody.  As a player of Legacy, you agree not to
break any of the below rules - EVEN IF you do not agree with what they say.
Ignorance is not an excuse, and violation of the rules is an indication
that you do not wish to play, and the immortals will act accordingly.

{Y*{x Discussion of alts is strictly prohibited on Legacy. This is a roleplay
  environment and revealing alts damages this atmosphere so {WDON'T DO IT{x
{Y*{x Harassment of players, especially newbies, in any form is not tolerated.
{Y*{x Do not use clients or triggers to do any of the following:  bot, auto-
  reconnect, or keep your character idle.  If you are suspected of such
  activity and do not respond, your character shall be punished.
{Y*{x Multiple playing and logins is strictly limited to characters level 
  14 and below. These people may have 2 low level characters on at once.
  For levels 15 and above helping your own  characters by ANY method is 
  considered cheating: this includes but is not limited to giving gold to 
  your other chars, spelling them, grouping with them, weakening mobs, or 
  transferring eq in any way (as in dropping it and logging on to an alt 
  to go pick it up).
{Y*{x Spam is rude and disrespectful to everybody else on the mud.  Do not do
  it.  Repeating anything 3 times in quick succession is one way spam will 
  be identified, but not the only way.  Also, conflicts inevitably arise on 
  muds between players.  Please keep it to private channels or tells.
{Y*{x Do not advertise other muds on Legacy.  There are many places to do so,
  such as www.mudconnect.com as well as usenet groups.  Logging on just to
  advertise your own mud is frowned upon everywhere, and will get you a
  quick nochannel.
{Y*{x If you find a bug, please report it, and do not use it.  The immortals 
  will get back to you.  
{Y*{x If you have any questions regarding these rules, ASK THE IMMS!  We will
  be more than happy to answer them.  If you go ahead and do something
  without asking us, do not blame us if you are punished.

Lastly, just because a rule is not posted here does not mean that it is not
cheating or harrassment. Any person having reasonable complaints should feel
free to respectfully note the immortals.

0 IMMORTALS STAFF~
The term "Immortals" (or Imms) refers to the staff of Legacy who work
hard to provide a great mudding experience for you, the player.  The
Imms run the mud, and are here to help you, but please do not ask any
imms to assist you in any way that might interfere with game balance,
for example: killing a mob, gathering EQ, locating objects, etc ... 
Because the Imms have much more power than ordinary mortals, they have 
many more rules they must follow.

If you have a question or concern regarding the game or your character,
you may address it to the Imms - that is what they are here for.  You
can either note to Imms or use the pray channel.  Also, if an Immortal
requests you to do something (or to stop doing something), please obey
them immediately.  An Immortal's word is final in every case.

0 | PIPE~
Syntax: <{Ycommand{x> {P|{x <{Ycommand{x>

The {Ppipe{x allows you to "{Ystack{x" commands.  You can {Ystack{x as many commands
as you wish  (assuming you do not exceed the maximum input length for
your list of commands).

You can place {Ytwo {Ppipes{x next to each other to nullify the separation
of commands.  Instead, it will just print {Yone{x {P|{x instead of the {P||{x you

~

0 ROOMS AREA BUILDING~
Our goal is to make {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x one of the best MUDs you will ever find.  Our
uniqueness manifests in many ways, one of which is allowing players {Yof
level 35 and up{x to have their own personal room complete with one mob and
3 objects.  It is {Y100 quest points{x if your room is open to all, or
{Y200 quest points{x if it is closed/private. You will need to work out all
the details listed below.  Clan rooms are {Y50 quest points{x, and are always
open to the entire clan.

1. {PName{x of the room, general {Pdescription{x of the room, and
   type of room ({Psafe{x, {Pnorecall{x, etc).

2. Location of the room (which {Parea{x), {Pwhat existing room{x it is to
   be connected to, {Pin which direction{x, and by what type of door
   ({Pno door{x, {Ppass door only{x, etc).

3. {YOne mobile{x and {Y3 objects{x ({Pfurniture/{Pbed{x, {Pfountain{x/{Pdrink{x,
   {Ppill{x/{Ppotion{x/{Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x), subject to the following restrictions:

   The {Pbed{x will be {P150/150 regen rate{x. The {Ppill{x/{Ppotion{x is {Ylevel 15{x,
   with {Yfour level 15 spells{x. The {CIMP{x reserves the right to restrict all
   spells on objects.  The {Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x level may be {Yno lower than level 15{x,
   with 3 charges of a spell {Yno higher than level 25{x.
   -The {Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x can also be a {Pfountain{x or another object, at the sole
    discretion of the {Cbuilders{x.

Due to {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x's EPA regulations, we can only allow one personal room
per player, and since we have become more aware of protecting our
environment, no portals are allowed in personal rooms. This ruling is
because there are several portals already established and maintained.

When you have completed all descriptions for room, mob, and objects,
submit it by {Pemail{V(preferably){x or by {Pnote{V(not recommended){x to the {Cbuilders{x,
or the {PI{Ym{Gp{Bl{Ve{Pm{Ye{Gn{Bt{Vo{Pr{x, who will check it and give it
to a {Cbuilder{x to code. Once your room is submitted and approved, it cannot be
changed (except for typos/bugs). Make sure it is {Y*exactly*{x the way you want it.
The {Cbuilders{x at Legacy are extremely helpful and will advise you if you run
into a problem.
~

0 HEALER~
The {Ghealer{x decided to grab a quick buck, and now charges for her heals.  Some
services are still {Cfree{x to players of level {Y10 or below{x.  To see
a full listing of the healer's services, type '{Gheal{x' at her residence. To
receive healing, bring plenty of money, and type '{Gheal <{Yspell{x>'.

0 AUTOTICK AUTOLIST AUTOLOOT AUTOGOLD AUTOSAC AUTOEXIT AUTOASSIST AUTORECALL AUTOSPLIT AUTOPEEK~
ROM uses various {Vautomatic actions{x to ease the boredom of always splitting
gold, sacrificing corpses and similar repetitive tasks.  The commands are:

{Vautolist{x  {c| {Ylist all automatic actions{x ({Gsee below{x)

{Vautopeek{x  {c| {Rpeek {Yat a character when you look at him/her/it{x

Typing a command sets the action , typing it again removes it.
~

0 AURA~
Syntax:
   {Vaura{x

The {Vaura{x command is used to give a gimmic aura to mortals.  This can be
done for several purposes.  It can be used for followers: {V({WL{Ci{Br{Ci{Te{Wl{x {GA{Hura{V){x, or
it can be used for punishment: {V(Probation Aura){x.  Auras are a gift, not a right,
and thus can be revoked or changed at any time at the discretion of the
Immortals.

{Vaura{x alone shows you your current aura.
~

-1 DEITY DEITIES~
A deity is the Immortal your character worships.  Each Immortal of this
mud may be either aligned Good, Neutral, or Evil.  Additionally, they
may be lawful, or chaotic.  Please pick a deity who best represents who
your character admires and strives to be like.  Although your first
deity is selected during character creation, you may decide to change who
you worship when you remort.  

{YSEE ALSO:{x Wizlist
~

0 RESTRING~
A {Crestring{x is the process of taking an item of equipment or a pet
and renaming them for a more personal touch.  {CRestrings{x are usually
a prize offered for valiant efforts during a quest.  When redeeming
a {Crestring{x, please provide the following information:

{VKeywords{x: {YWords that identify{x the item/pet
	  (sword, twilight, dreamslayer)(kitten moxie)
{VShort{x:    Description seen when you type "{YInventory{x" or "{YEquipment{x"
	  or pet's basic name.
	  (Twilight Dreamslayer)(Moxie the Kitten)
{VLong{x:     Description of something {Ysitting in a room or on the ground{x
	  (a cold sword lies here)(Moxie is here, licking her paws)
{VExtended{x: *{GObjects Only{x* Extra Keywords and Descriptions for stuff
	  that you have to {Yexplicitly look at{x.
	  ('hilt' - The hilt is carved from an ebony bone)
~

0 SHOWLAST FINGER FINGERINFO~
Syntax:
   {Vfinger{x <{Ycharacter{x>
   {Vfinger{x <{Ycharacter{x>@<{Ymud{x>
   {Vfinger private{x
   {Vfingerinfo{x
   {vshowlast{x

This command will display the last time a character was playing on
{bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x along with several items of other useful unformation.
Abbreviations cannot be used for character names.

You can also use finger to get information on characters from
other MUDs. For example:
finger bob@soe

The {Vfinger private{x command will toggle the appearance of your {Yemail{x
{Yaddress{x in the {Vfinger data{x.  This setting defaults to off.

The {Vfingerinfo{x command is identical to the description command.  It
can be used to add additional information to your {Vfinger data{x.

The {Vshowlast{x command will toggle whether a player's last time on
displays in the finger listing.

{YNOTE{x: The {Vfinger data{x does not {Yupdate{x until your character has been
saved by either the {Yautosave feature{x or by typing the {Ysave{x command.
~

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.
~

0 QUEST QUESTS~
Certain characters in the game will allow you to go on {Yquests{x to recover
an item or {Pkill{x a mob. To go on a {Yquest{x, you must be in the
same room with a questmaster. When you successfully complete a {Yquest{x, you
will receive a certain number of {Yquest {Gpoints{x ({YQP{x). These points
may be saved up and used to buy restrings, practices, or player rooms. See
{RHELP QP{x for other uses for Quest Points.

The {YQUEST{x command is used for information about your current {Yquest{x,
to request a {Yquest{x from a questmaster, etc. Commands are as follows:

{YQUEST {MPOINTS{x - Gives your current number of {Yquest {Mpoints{x. This
command may be used anywhere.

{YQUEST {BINFO{x - If you are on a {Yquest{x, this will remind you who or
what you are after.

{YQUEST {CTIME{x - Gives the amount of {Ctime{x remaining on your current
{Yquest{x, or the amount of {Ctime{x until you can request another {Yquest{x.
This command may be used anywhere.

{YQUEST {VREQUEST{x - Petitions the questmaster to send you on a {Yquest{x.
If you accept the {Yquest{x, you will be given a real time limit (in minutes)
in which you must complete the {Yquest{x. If you are on a {Yquest{x to kill a
creature, when you come across that creature you will see a {P[TARGET]{x
notice before it. This is the creature you are to kill.

{YQUEST {GCOMPLETE{x - Once you have completed your {Yquest{x and recovered
the item or killed the mob or whatever, you must return to the questmaster
who sent you on the {Yquest{x and use this command. If you have successfully
completed your {Yquest{x, he will reward you with {Yquest {Mpoints{x. Once
you complete a {Yquest{x you cannot request another for 10 minutes.

{YQUEST {PFORFEIT{x - This option will stop the current {Yquest{x and
{Pforfeit{x your prize. You will have you wait to {Yquest{x again for another
{M10{x minutes.

0 QP QPPRICE~
You can purchase a number of useful oddities from immortals with qp.
The following is a list, with prices. 

      {BOne Spell{x         : {Y50 QP
      {BOne Restring{x      : {Y25 QP
      {BA Lesser Enchant{x  : {Y35 QP
      {BA Greater Enchant{x : {Y50 QP
      {BOne Practice{x      : {Y20 QP
      {BOne Train{x         : {Y200 QP{x

{CEnchants{x can be either weapon or armor.  Lesser enchants are from
immortals level 99 or below, and have a small chance to be brilliant
blue.  Greater enchants are from level 100 imms and are guaranteed
to be brilliant blue.  Weapon and armor enchants will not exceed {P+14{x
above original stats or {P+18{x total, whichever is lower.  Trade-ins 
and refunds are not accepted after enchanting of equipment.

You may also {Glower{x equipment that is above the mortal plane with qp.
You must be a hero (level 91) in order to have eq lowered.  The
following are the prices.

{Y125 qp{x to lower any piece of level {P92{x equipment
{Y150 qp{x to lower any piece of level {P93{x equipment
{Y175 qp{x to lower any piece of level {P94 and above{x equipment
~

0 BACKUP~
Syntax: {Cbackup{x

This command saves a backup copy of your character in a separate directory.
Unlike {Csave{x, this is *not* automatic but needs {Yyou{x to do it.
Having a backup copy of your character is good if your player file becomes
damaged somehow, the Imms can then restore your character from the backup.
We recommend doing {Rbackup{x about once a day.

Everytime you log in, the mud will notify you if it has been an hour or
longer since your last backup.	After 24 hours, the message will change
colors to catch your attention.

{YSEE ALSO:{x Save
~

0 STRENGTH STR~
{CStrength{x as the name suggests is a mark on how strong you are. The
stronger you are the more damage you do, the more you can carry (weight
wise) and you are able to wield heavier weaponry. 
~

0 DEXTERITY DEX~
{CDexterity{x is a measure of your agility and prowess. The higher
it is the easier it is to avoid attacks.
~

0 INTELLIGENCE INT~
{CIntelligence{x is a mark of how clever you are. Intelligence is used for 
gaining more mana per level, specifically by magic-using classes. It also
guides how much of a percentage increase you get when you practice.
~

0 WISDOM WIS~
{CWisdom{x is used to define how wise you are, and marks how many practices
you get per level.
~

0 CONSTITUTION CON~
{CConstitution{x is the mark of how healthy you are, the higher your
constitution the more hit point you'll gain per level.
~

0 CHARISMA CHR~
{CCharisma{x affects how you interact with monsters and the Hidden Fates.
Specifically, a high charisma makes aggressive monsters less likely to
attack you (they may hesitate just long enough for you to wander on by,
or long enough for you to have a nice nap). Also, with a high charisma,
you have a chance of getting 2 {Ytrains{x {G(!){x each time you gain a level.
~

0 VIDEO DARK VT100 FLASH~
Syntax: {Cvideo flash <{Yon, off, or underline{x>
        {Cvideo dark  <{Ynormal or modify{x>
        {Cvideo vt100 <{Yon or off{x>
        {Cvideo codes <{Yshow or hide{x>

{Cvideo flash{x controls how text designed to flash ({{f) will appear on your
screen (flashing, normal, or underlined). Underlined text may appear as
reversed video, depending on your screen emulator. {Cvideo dark{x controls
how you will see black ({{k) and charcoal ({{c) text (normal means you
see them as black or charcoal, modify means black and charcoal will appear
as grey). {Cvideo vt100{x {Yon{x sends output to your terminal in vt100 mode
(which may well not be what you want, so {Cvideo vt100{x {Yoff{x will fix it).
{Cvideo codes{x {Yshow{x will show you the code sequences used in colored strings
that you see.  This will probably give you a headache, so you can use
{Cvideo codes{x {Yoff{x to turn it off again.
~

0 CLEAR~
Syntax: {Cclear{x

Clears the screen.

0 MULTIPLAY MULTIPLAYING MULTIPLAYERS MULTI~
The act of simultaneously playing more than one character at the same time
is called multiplaying.  We understand that many people share an IP address

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, and
after the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  When you buy your
pet, you are given a chance to name it; the syntax is:
     {Ybuy {c<petspecies> {R<name>{x.
Thereafter, you can refer to your pet by its name in {Yorders{x, {Ylook{x, and
other commands.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell 
duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 45 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if someone is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground won't be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 STORAGE VACATION~
If you are leaving for an extended period of time, you may request that
your character be put in storage, to avoid the necessary cleanup of
inactive characters.  If you wish to do this, post a note to immortal
or send an email to legacy@kyndig.com.
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: {Cbug{x <{Ymessage{x>
        {Ctypo{x <{Ymessage{x>

These commands will take your message and record it into a file as feedback
to the mud implementors.
~

0 QUIT	RENT SAVE~
Syntax: {Cquit{x
        {Csave{x

{CSave{x saves your character and objects.  The game saves your character
every 15 minutes, and this is the preferred method of saving.  Typing {Csave{x
will block all other commands for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds generated too much lag.)

Some objects, such as certain keys, may not be saved.

{CQuit{x leaves the game.  You may {Cquit{x anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

{CQuit{x automatically does a {Ysave{x, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to {Ysave{x before {Cquit{x.  If you
get into the habit of using {Cquit{x without {Ysave{x, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no {PRENT{x in this mud.  Just {Ysave{x and {Cquit{x whenever you want to leave.

~

0 TRUST~
Having trust enables your character to have access to commands at 
your trust level.  However, it does not change the permanant stats 
of your character.  Thus, having trust of 91 allows your character 
to have access to the hero channel and the scon command even though 
you are below the required level.
~

0 HERO~
{WHero{x is the only mortal level with a name. It is the name of level 91,
the last non-immortal level. It takes a lot of work to get here, so
heroes are usually held in high regard in the game. Heroes gain a number
of convenient privileges when they reach this level. For one, they can
die without losing experience.

On the other hand, heroes do not gain experience. When they are done
showing off their newly-found power, their best bet is to ask an Imm
for a {CREMORT{x and start over as a rather powerful newbie.

~

0 COPYOVER~
{CCOPYOVER{x is an imm command which is used to re-load the game for
changes in areas or program software. {YMortals{x should know this:

A copyover is not always successful, it may crash the game. You should
{CSAVE{x when a copyover is announced.

If the copyover crashes the game, try to reconnect again soon. The game
should be back up within less than a minute.

A copyover always results in a complete game reset. If you were fighting a
mob at the time of copyover, when it's over you may be facing a brand new
and healthy copy of the mob, whereas you will have the same wounds you had
before the copyover.  If you are in an aggressive mob's room at copyover
time, that mob will be there after the copyover and will attack you.  All
quests will be forfeited. The donation pit will also be emptied, all shop-
keepers will revert to their normal inventory, and you will lose anything in
your inventory which is more than seven levels above you. Thus,

- When {CCOPYOVER{x is announced, {Yfinish any current fight as soon as
  possible, and move to some place where you will be safe from aggressive
  mobs!{x  {PDo not start any new quests or fights!{x

- If you are in the middle of a quest or a fight and need some time to
  finish up, use {WGOSSIP{x to inform the immortal and (s)he will usually
  give you a chance to get ready.

- Buy anything in the shop that you might have been saving for, and get
  what you need from the pit. And get someone of higher level to hold that
  precious item you just bought at auction but can't use for a few levels.

When you see a message saying
   {W*** COPYOVER by (immortal) ... please remain seated!{x
then you can start playing as soon as you can move again.
~

0 MOOCHING~
As in real life, there are players who accomplish a lot on their own through
hard work and using their head, and there are the {Ymoochers{x who loudly (and
often obnoxiously) beg everyone for help in getting experience, equipment,
gold or spell-ups. The clever workers and explorers get a lot more out of the
game, believe me! It's OK to ask for help if you get into unexpected trouble,
the helpful folks at Legacy will be happy to assist if they can. You can ask
for the occasional bit of information if you've tried to come by it on your
own and can't seem to find it. It's {Pnot{x OK to try to get people to help
you with every step because you're {Ytoo lazy!{x Check all these resources
before {Ywhining{x for help:

  it to Deirdre, the Healer 1 north of the Temple of Mota (Recall), she will
  give you a newbie bag with useful equipment and helpful hints in it, even
  some food and drink.
- Other equipment and some silver can be gotten by killing mobs in MUD school
  and the Fair. The directions to the Fair are in the {CNewbie Bag{x.
- You are born with a map of Midgaard in your hand. There is also a {Cmap shop{x
  at the west end of Poor Alley, which runs a bit south of Main Street.
- Before you ask '{GWhere can I go to level?{x', try exploring on your own
  for a while! Check the list from the {RAREAS{x command for reference.
- If you do need to ask for help, be polite. People have their own characters
  to level here, and are doing you a favor by helping you.

91 APPLICATION~
Applying for Immortality

The final step for any mortal is the assumption of immortal power. In order
to climb the last few steps to immortality, you must submit an application.
This help file will give you some direction as to the content of that
application.

First, what this application should not be:
Too long
Too short
A glorification of you
A diatribe of us
and, most importantly,
DO NOT BE VAGUE

What your submission must include:

1. Tell us what you have done.
Have you been a Clan leader? Can you code? Can you build? Have you coded
for us already? Have you been building for us in your spare time? Knowing
what you have done can help us picture what you will accomplish in your
immortality.

2. Tell us what you want to do.
Everyone has plans for the mud. Many applications address this point, but
we want you to understand the importance of your ideas. We want highly
motivated imms who know what they want to do and to not need to be told
what to do. If you do not tell us what you want to do, then it seems you do
not want to do anything.

3. Tell us how you want to do it.
This is the section where everyone has problems. Applicants talk about
changing the mud. They weave fine tapestries of gold and light to produce a
picture of the mud as it would be if they were an immortal. Then, they
forget to tell us how they plan to make their dream real. Every good idea
has a workable plan. You must tell us your plan or suffer from the sad
reality that we cannot read your mind.

Something your application can include:
Flavor/Personality
If you like to roleplay, write the note in character. Nothing is more
pleasing than to have an immortal who has personality. Write in your
accent. Use your mannerisms. We enjoy a good read as much as the next
person. A word of caution though: Do not overwhelm the intent of the paper
with your roleplay. The submission is there to be evaluated on your ability
to contribute to the mud, not how convincingly you can portray a down and
out blacksmith with only one hand and a lisp.

Remember:
This is just a *guide*. Do not follow this help file to the letter. You are
writing a paper that supports your bid for immortality. Our help file tells
you what general topics you need to cover in order to make a good
application. Just because you follow this help does not mean you will be
made an immortal, but it will definitely produce an application that is
more than and better than:
'I know a lot about the mud. Make me an imm'

0 LEGACY SET IMMLEGACIES~
Besides the Questmaster, the immortals also will hold frequently hold
quests for your enjoyment.  You can collect a legacy set from any imm
using that imm's tokens.  The {BI{Cmm {BL{Cegacy {BS{Cystem{x is as follows.

There will be three types of tokens:

    {GHidden{x tokens, dropped randomly throughout the realm
    {VTrivia{x tokens, given for when trivia is held
    {YQuest{x tokens, as rewards for quests the imm holds

In order to receive a particular imm's legacy set, you must collect
fifty ({P50{x) of each token.  Sometimes, rare {Ww{Vi{Cl{Bd{x tokens might be 
available that count as any one.  Once you have collected the {P150
tokens{x, you turn it in to that particular imm, who will give you your
choice of {BL{Cegacy {BS{Cet{x.

{WNote: Imp legacies require 150 tokens, but in no particular assortment.
        The rule of 50 of each token does not apply.{x

1.{x A token for {Y1,000 {xquest points{x  ({Y2,000{x if it is an {BI{Cmp{B L{Cegacy{x)
2.{x A token for {G90 levels{x (2 tokens if it is an {BI{Cmp{B L{Cegacy{x)
3.{x {BTwo pieces of eq{x, ownered and designed by you, using the points system.
   The rules on ClanEQ will apply ({BI{Cmp {Bl{Cegacies{x will have their own unique, 
   pre-designed eq, if you choose this option)

{VGood luck!{x :)

0 ALTERNATE ALTERNATES ALT ALTS~
An {Calternate{x, or '{Calt{x', is a character played by the same person as
another character.  This is allowed, and even encouraged, as part of the
fun is trying out classes and races that you may be unfamiliar with.  Many
players have more than one character, and most try to roleplay them
separately from their other characters.  This too is encouraged, many
find the challenge of roleplaying different characters stimulating.

Roleplay is not forced on {BL{Ce{gg{Wa{Cc{By{x, but this should not be confused with
tolerance of making it difficult to roleplay.  Players work hard to keep
their alts separate, but alas, it is natural to blur the difference
between player and character.  People tend to familiarize themselves with
the player, and in doing so, often fail to treat their characters as
individuals.  Thus, many players do not reveal the identities of all their
characters.

If you know who a player's alts are, do NOT reveal them to others without
express permission from that player.  It is considered rude and extremely
bad etiquette, and is not tolerated on Legacy.  This applies to any form
of communication on the mud, including notes and channels.  {PPunishment{x for
revealing alts is swift and harsh.  Please, respect your fellow players,
don't destroy the possibility of roleplay for others.
