0 DUEL ARENA DUELS CHALLENGEdes you with a small but powerful editor for notes
(this includes {YNOTE{xs, {YIDEA{xs, {YROLEPLAY{x notes, etc.) and your {Ydescription{x.

You can't use {REDIT{x to *create* a new text, you have to start it with
{RNOTE SUBJECT{x (etc.) or {RDESC +{x . Once there is something there, you can
switch into the editor with {REDIT NOTE{x or {REDIT DESCRIPTION{x. {REDIT NOTE{x will
figure out which {Ykind{x of note you've started and go to work on it.

You then use the {CEDIT{x commands to work on your text. For your convenience,
most commands abbreviate to {RED{x and a single character. Here's the list.
All numbers given are {P*examples*{x.

{RED{xIT             - gives you your current status and a little bit of
                   helpful information, including a reference here.

{RED{xIT {RNOTE{x        - starts editing a note, idea, roleplay, etc.
{RED{xIT {RDESC{xRIPTION - starts editing your description.
{PED{xIT {YHELP{x <ID>     - start editing a help file (IMM only)

{RED{xIT {RDO{xNE        - finishes editing and saves the changes to your text.
{RED{xIT {RCANCEL{x      - stops editing and discards any changes edited.

{RED{xIT {RL{xIST        - prints out your whole text
{RED{xIT {R3 9 L{xIST    - prints out lines 3 through 9 of your text.
   When you do something, {CEDIT{x only shows you a few of the lines around
   the current line. But you can use {RED{xIT {RL{xIST any time to see all text.

{RED{xIT {R8{x               - moves the {W<current line>{x to line 8.

{RED{xIT {RI{xNSERT {RHello!{x   - inserts 'Hello!' after the {W<current line>{x.
{RED{xIT {R0 I{xNSERT {RHello!{x - inserts 'Hello!' after line 0 (the beginning).
{RED{xIT {R6 I{xNSERT        - inserts a blank line after line 6.
   The {W<current line>{x moves to the line you just inserted, so you can
   quickly enter multiple lines of text by typing
      {RED I blah blah blah{x
      {RED I blah blah blah{x

{RED{xIT {RD{xELETE          - deletes the {W<current line>{x.
{RED{xIT {R1 D{xELETE        - deletes line 1.
{RED{xIT {R2 4 D{xELETE      - deletes lines 2 through 4.

{RED{xIT {RC{xHANGE {Rmox magic{x         - changes 'mox' to 'magic' on {W<current line>{x.
{RED{xIT {R8 C{xHANGE {Rtwo six{x                   - changes 'two' to 'six' on line 8.

0 PK PKFLAGkilling{x and {Yplayer stealing{x is restricted to only those who have their
{PPK flag{x set to the {Ron{x position.  Also, {PPK{x is restricted to within
eight levels. In addition, if you {PPK{x or {YPSteal{x from an injured player or a sleeping player, then you will receive a {PKILLER{x or {BTHIEF{x
flag.  Once you have one of these flags, players outside of eight levels
can attack you.  Once you have initiated combat against someone, the injured
player restriction is lifted for that combat session.  Thus, if your opponent
flees, you can still track them down.
