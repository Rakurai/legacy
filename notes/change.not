Subject Non-lowered hero weapons~
Text
In order to create some competition for the tempered throwing daggers,
the Looneysword, Claws of Earth, and Tofstick have all been improved a bit. 
Hopefully this will provide some variety in the non-lowered hero weapons. 
(I know, none of them are the same average or higher, they're still better
than before)

bunch of lil changes and one big one.  mobs now check correctly for walking
in air/water rooms, i.e. they need to fly or have a boat.  skill in swimming
lets you walk into water rooms also.  'movement' has been changed to 'stamina',
and most non-automatic skills cost stamina to perform.  regen and gains on leveling
for stamina and mana have been reworked a lot, most of you won't see a difference
in your mana regen, but stamina regen is increased significantly.  the command
'skills' has a new look, goes along with 'spells', and it lists stamina costs to
perform a skill.  a lot of you will see your stamina change when you log on, because
of the change to how it's calculated when it's gained, i put something in to roll
you a new stamina value the first time you come on after the change, so you won't
find yourself slighted.  also, any hero or remort should be able to get level 92+
items from the pit now :)

(mages, necromancers, and clerics) can cast with less lag than other classes.

is a derivative of the same, a means of communicating with lurkers so
as not to give them away on public channels.  i'm using 'lurk' incorrectly,
lurk was actually for clan leaders, and incog for heroes and remorts

Text
Sorry, was kinda in a hurry, guess I should explain what a PK timer is
to those of you who haven't played muds with them.  When you engage in
a player vs player fight, a timer is set on you, and while that timer is
active, you're not safe.  You can be pushed or drug out of safe rooms,
other players won't get a killer flag by attacking you in any case,
and the gods will ignore your prayers for recall.  Along with this,
you can now flee while slowed, except that your dexterity factors a
great deal into the chances, and slow has been modified to increase
the dexterity penalty.  Slow checks saves now, and saves have been
adjusted a lot to be more based on actual saving throws rather than
level.  Also, focus no longer affects scrolls/staves/wands, wrath and
sunray have had their damage lowered somewhat, and focus affects
chain spells a *little* more now, had to do it for the removal of
focus effect from spells cast from objects.

and so on happened, the little bug 'put all.something locker' doesn't
work anymore, but mainly because it doesn't have to.  it used to not
let you put a container with a weight modifier in your locker, it's an
unnecessary precaution now so it's removed.

oh yeah, and the stuff with mobs not showing messages when they clambered
to their feet is fixed, so your bash triggers should work again :P

Subject Detect Hidden and Invis~
Text
Invisibility is a very impressive and actually rather rare spell, good
for spooking the peasants and infiltrations alike.  However, it, hide, and
the spells detect invis and detect hidden are a bit underused and
underpowered because of the way eq and mobs are now.  So, after the next
copyover, the belt of magic power and the sheandra junk will no longer
detect hidden or invis.  Also, 60 mobs (well, 58 separate vnums, sue me for
rounding) have lost the ability to detect invis or hidden thus far, and
there will probably be more.  Not all of them are aggressive, but some were,
so there are some definite positive sides.  Anyway, if there are any
complaints, address them solely to me and Mont, I guess.  Try and hold down
the name-calling, please.  ;)

Text
the chances of bash were being affected by your victim's AC vs
bash/blunt weapons, i saw a typo in it the other day while looking at
how the chances were calculated so i could use something similar elsewhere.
thing was, your AC vs bash was being taken into account backwards, whoever
whoever put it in, i assumed, had just forgotten that AC is negative,
so it was actually making you easier to bash the better your armor class
was.  i had one of my all too common moments of stupidity, and changed it
thinking it was a typo, which is why all of a sudden it was so hard to
bash anything.  thinking about it this morning, though, i realized it was
very intentional.  AC vs bash is a misnomer, it should be AC vs blunt.
AC vs blunt damage is gained through heavy armors, thick plate, shields, etc.
all of which make you an easy target to be knocked down :)  so, after next
copyover, it'll be back to normal.

dealing with mobs fleeing and rotating, namely, they won't flee as
much because they'll wait for the end of their combat round instead
of in the middle of it.  Fire breath blindness is much decreased, should
average out to 2 ticks, 3 at most.  Pets won't load their spell

need to be expanded on.  Unfortunately, the only way to do this is
by resetting everyone's color settings.  In a few days, you'll log

you'll have to set them again (if you even changed them in the

Subject Colors, score, and other stuff~
Text
Okay, the color wipe I warned everyone about a few days ago has been done,
everyone will need to set up their channel and score colors again.  Some major
internal changes to this happened, it's expandable now, and even the command
has changed a little bit.  Color settings are part of the config command now,
type 'config' if you didn't know this was here.  Config color handles all of
your personal colors, but I wouldn't leave you oldbies having to learn new
commands, 'color' is a shortcut for 'config color', so you can still change
or check your settings with the color command.  The syntax is:

color <channel|score|misc> <name of field> <color name>

Example, to change the color of gossip to {Yyellow{x:
color channel gossip yellow

The same syntax is used for your score and other settings.  Typing
'color score' will show you all the possible fields you can color in your
score, and what they're set at now.  There will hopefully be a help file
explaining this soon :)

Thanks to Kazander and Viro, we have a new version of score available for
you guys to use.  It's automatically set on new characters, but you can
type 'newscore' to change to the new one.  Check it out, it's nice looking, IMHO.

Some smaller things have been fixed, such as push and drag, they've
been rewritten.  The internal pc_index has been tweaked a bit, it won't
mess up on players with multiple capitalized letters in their names now.
Player to player visibility has been implemented as outlined in previous
notes.  Gaining a skill now sets it to evolution 1, not 0.  EQ etched
by acid has it's base armor class affected instead of an applied affect.
Bugs with player sex checking have been fixed, nothing short of divine
intervention can change a player's true sex now.

Oh, and the spells quick and bone wall no longer show up on lists :P  that was
a mistake, I've refunded those that bought them.

You may notice on our entry screen that we are now MyLegacy v1.4.
What this means is, that the mud now uses a very fast and powerful
databasing engine called MySQL for some of it's information storage and
retrieval.  We will depend on it increasingly over the next few months,
as we move more and more of our outdated file system to the database.
We will change to v2.0 when we have eliminated all text files from the
mud's standard routine, including player files and area files.  If I'm
not mistaken, at that point we will be unlike any ROM based mud in
existance, so excuse me if I'm rather excited about it ;)  The first things
that have been changed are our sitebans and disabled commands, eliminating
two text files and one linked list from the mud.  Anyway, going to get
back to work, just wanted to share that with everyone.  The next
stuff to go in will probably be help files and a constant connected
MySQL backend, while I'll be working on site indexing and some of

fixed a couple of bugs, next copyover.
there was a problem with pfile saving, specifically with some of the flag
sets such as censor options.  in that case, if you had no censor options
turned on, it reset your censor to default when you logged on next.  the
other problem was with the permanent stats of new characters, it turned
out that it only actually saved your max hp, mana, and stamina the
first time you leveled, so that's fixed now.  pfiles that were affected
by this aren't changed, it'll just save them correctly now, sooo...
if you log on and your censor settings are messed up, just set them how
you want and they'll save correctly next time :)

All breath spells do 1/3 less damage vs players.  They still win in

will continue to monitor it for balance.  Sunray and Ray of Truth have been
tweaked around, both should be less effective vs good aligns, more vs evil
aligns.  Color spray is a little worse at blinding things, and has had the
mana cost raised ever so slightly.  The harmful spell group should actually
hurt things now, not just give them an itch.  Harm is redone.  Don't worry
about that damage max of 100 and min of 20 any more.

Text
After careful consideration, weighing what all players both mortal and

activity.  Let me start by saying there are not enough active players on
Legacy for me to fairly evaluate the clans.  By active I do not mean signs
on, reads notes or types who and leaves.  I mean actual players.  However
some clans have MORE activity than others which in their opinion is not fair.
Now originally I had noted the clans saying I was watching activity to start
declaring clans fallen for lack of participation....  I changed my mind. 
What I am going to do which I find to be fair due to the fact that membership
affects your clanpower is this : 

{YPeriodically I will be checking clanlists and checking all it's members to
find out who was on when.  ANY clan member that has NOT been on in 30 or more
days will be declanned by me.  {PThe exception to this is mortals that have
requested to be in storage for a set time and purpose.  {x 

{C This is a TEMPORARY SOLUTION that may be changed if and when we get more

Ok we have decided to change this rule slightly.  I am going to be as
specific as possible so that there are no misunderstandings or harsh feelings
for this rule being broken.  Please refer to help rules and help multiplay
for future reference.  We have decided to allow level 14 and below to have to
characters signed on at the same time.  BOTH characters must be level 14 or
below.  Remorts are not given this privilege.  This is strictly for the
newbies.  Gang this is a privilege and like most things in life if you abuse
it you lose it.  We the imms hope that this helps the new mortals have a more
enjoyable start here on Legacy.  Please address any questions regarding this

In this copyover we should have the following changes.
The flee command now takes into consideration your dexxterity and your wisdom. It also checks your weight.
So high-wisdom and low weight are good things.
The owhere command no longer spams out aconnection (I think) and it condenses output. This prevents duplicate items in the same place from being displayed.
The say command should display "yell" or "ask" if you end your sentence with a "!" or "?". This might not be working yet....

If you have any questions, problems or comments, please let me know.

To do so, please type:

For example, remort outsider elf urza I'm cool

This change has not yet been properly tested.

However, there is a small price to be paid for this. Whenever you don't have enough money on your character, the bank takes a 10% surcharge on your item.

Good day all. I am happy to report a few small tweeks and changes to Legacy.
First of all, I realized that the bank was taking too much money when using the new Debit feature.
You now get back exact change for your purchases, no rounding up from the shop keepers.

The big change, however, is for Paladins.
Paladins may now learn and use the skill Lay on Hands. For those of you unfamiliar with this skill, it allows a Paladin to heal another character.
Paladins may not heal themselves with Lay on Hands.
The new "lay" skill heals minor amounts of damage done to other characters at no cost to the Paladin.
A Paladin may use Lay a number of times per day, the number of times goes up with his/her level.
At this time, non-paladins may not use the Lay on Hands skill.

A high dex pet would, for example, gain you a dexterity point. A strong pet would gain you a strength point.
When your pet dies, your ability score returns to its previous state.

Lodasian brought up a good point yesterday. That is that some mob names don't match their discriptions.

Trying to look at, kill or consider such a mob can be annoying to say the least.
To get around this, you can use "con 1." or "look 2." The number being the position of the mob in the room.

If you encounter such a mis-named mob, please send me a note with the following information.
The area you were in, the discription of the mob or object you are trying to look at.
For example:
"I found a mob today that does not match its name with its discription. I was in the Old Wood and encountered a mob called "a walking tree". However, it does not match "walking" or "tree".

Legacy now has the ability to connect to another MUD through a relay server.

At this time, the only feature of the connection is to share gossip.
If another copy of Legacy were to connect with us, the gossip channel would be shared by both sides.

It is my hope to soon have a command to dynamically connect to the relay server and add some more functionaliy to the connection.

Subject Spells and Objects~

Okay, I tripped over a really odd bug today.
If an object had a spell cast upon it that acted as an affect and if that spell was one that could only be cast on objects AND if that object was equiped by a character, the MUD would run into a series of memory issues.
Basically it would choke trying to use the wearer as an object. Everything when down hill from there.

The fix for this was to edit all of the spells that use objects only to make sure they didn't accidently target a character.
I think I got them all. However, the first person to prove me wrong gets 5 QP.

This can be tested by putting an object in your inventory, casting a spell upon it, then trying to wear it. If you get some error, then you've found the bug. If everything looks normal, then...well, I RULE.

This has now been corrected. I'm not sure exactly what was supposed to be there (the original builder being long gone) so I guessed.
Feel free to go visit the Toray area and see our new...er old, yet newly visable "old man".

Text
Porthios brought to my attention a bug in the new way in which brew and scribe work.
It seems that the potions and scrolls were not being created at the proper level in each case.
I believe this issue to be fixed. Please make some scrolls, and brew some potions to let me know if I'm correct.

To bring everyone up to speed, Brew and Scribe can now be used to make potions and scrolls at various levels, not just the level of the caster.

If anyone can find a bug in the new brew and scribe commands, they will receive five QP for reporting the error.

I just wanted to let everyone know that Asmadi and I did some work Friday night.

Some people have noted that getting spammed from another MUD is annoying.
To make you happy, I have made any data coming in from another MUD a channel.
You can change whether you receive text from other MUDs (tells, gossip, who data) via the "remote" command.

Subject Communication R Us~
Text
Hello everyone. I am happy to roll out a few more tweaks to Legacy's code.
First off, I think I've finally got the following channels to send cross-MUD.
These are: Grats, Flame, Music and non-predefined Socials.
This is in addition to the Gossip and Tell we were sharing before.
I don't think I have to mention this, but I will anyway. Please be
respectful of everyone, on both MUDs. Now that we share many channels,
including Flame, we should keep in mind other people's feelings.
I'm sure everyone here is mature and respectful; that's why I'm happy to be a member of this community.

This new string of code changes hasn't been completely tested and is not yet implemented on SoE. So it may still be buggy. Hopefully, with Asmadi's help, both MUDs will be talking up a storm soon.

Another thing I am happy to report is the ability to Reply cross-MUD.
This has been a long time coming and took a bit of an overhaul to perform.
I hope (really hope) that I managed to add this feature without breaking anything. If you do find something doesn't work properly anymore and report it, you'll get a quest point.
The Reply syntax is the same as before. So, if you get a Tell Message from bob@soe, you can send a Tell back by typing "reply hi there"

I hope to have remote Finger abilities soon, as well as some other minor tweaks. As always, I would love to hear your suggestions.
One more thing...I know I know, this is getting long.
The begining of August marks the one year anniversery of my coming to code for Legacy.
..(Waits for the clapping to die down.) ...
As such, I will be scattering some special hidden tokens across the land.
Buy 'em, trade 'em, cash them in for cool prizes.

Your Coder on Your MUD for Your Legacy,

Subject Grant Command~
Text
Due to a special request from our fearless (and beautiful) leader, Teotwawki,
I have created a new command for Immortals.
This command is called Grant and allows an IMM
to grant special access to one command by one mortal.
This helps step around Wiz Groups, but should be used
rarely. Most mortals will not need special access to commands.

At this time, a player may be granted 32 commands.
These commands are *remembered* by the system, and are
not removed when they quit.
Please also note that a command must be spelled out
if it is granted. For example:
This is correct: grant outsider add wizhelp
This is _not_: grant outsider add wizh

For further security, the player granted the command should also
spell it out.

Please see "help grant" for more information.
Your Coder,
Outsider

ok, got a few things, most behind the scenes though.  just thought you
guys should know.

i put in a signal handler to help prevent some crashes, although with this
latest copyover it may now be unnecessary, as i think i got the problem fixed.
fixed a bug that was making it so clanned players in groups with people from
other clans couldn't walk around in their clanhall.  removed a program we used
to run called keep_alive, it was buggy and unnecessary (i was a n00b coder
when i made it).  i put in a much updated mysql wrapper file that is much
more useful than our old stuff, and saves a lot of code.  along with that,
fixed a whole bunch of mysql things, again leftovers from my n00bdom.
various other fixes, mostly having to do with mysql stuff.

also, new help system put in, type 'help clan' to get an idea of what it can
do.  i'll put in a help file for it tomorrow.

oh yeah, and it's christmastime!!  the help files have our traditional blinky
christmas lights again, and i changed the weather a bit for the season.

Mob stats are no longer crazy high.  It was originally designed as a 60 level
mud, so any mob at level 50ish had maxed out stats.  This affects things like
dodge, parry, bash, and many more.  Mobs stats are basically cut in half now,
which will probably result some mobs being less effective at some skills.  

Along the same lines, the dexterity modifier of haste and slow has been
removed, for mobs and players.  It may seem sensible for it to affect dex,
but it was actually double counting haste and slow.  Maybe something for
evolved haste/slow later?  

Dodge and blur chances have been modified a lot to account for mob stat
changes, should be more realistic for haste/slow and size modifiers.  

Shield block is much more effective now, and might get better later.  It was
almost pointless to have, the default chance of actually blocking was so low
that it only went off on a critical fail (5% chance).

Subject help file editing~
Text
If you have the building group, check out {Yhedit{x.  It lets you create new help
files and set the values, and it will immediately appear in the game.  A few
points to go over.  First, type help on something, and notice that for imms,
you see t the help file's file and ID.  The ID is how you interact with that
particular file for editing.  

To create a new helpfile, you only need some keywords.  To create one for the
new command, I would type {Yhedit new hedit{x.  This will tell you the new help's
ID so you can keep working on it, in this case 623.  Next I would set the
help's level to restrict it to imms: {Yhedit level 623 92{x.  I could also set
the file (hgroup) and order number (onum).  Next, I want to edit the text,
which you could do in one string with the hedit command.  

An easier way to edit the text of the help is with the {Pedit{x command, which I
modified so you can do something like {Pedit help 623{x.  This will start the
editor working on the help text, you can make changes, and {Pedit done{x when
you're finished.  

Hopefully this will make it easier to update information about the mud. 
Don't go all crazy changing things without some group discussion :)
