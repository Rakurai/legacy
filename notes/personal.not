Well lets start with shell access...  I am guessing the following imms have
access You, Me, Vegita, Outsider, Monty, Xenith, Liriel(shouldn't but prolly
does), Possibly Tarrant (which is Nylan btw), Possibly Viro, and I pray to
GOD not Alara.  Plus Porthios, whom I have never met.  I never see Urza aka
Blackmage but he is a quest imm, Navarre is a quest imm.  Now for Elders.  I
covered Liriel, Viro, Xenith, Tarrant....  Kismet was a kick ass quest imm,
Jubei sucked but was a quest imm, and ebony was a beginner builder that never
built me anything.  Out of the departed....  Well hmmm Alara, Azreal and Qaz
I think had shell at one point in time.  Now to be honest..  I thought they
were all locked out when we changed password.  Oh and then there is
Kenneth...  He was my admin help.  Me, I build and I admin but I really would
like some help with building but I am not a great teacher so I need someone
that knows how to build.  Navarre is a quest imm.  And I think that wraps it
up.  Anything else you want to know?  Just note me.  

Your humble servent.

Subject elder/departed~
Text
Ok I have a reasonable question.  Some of our imms that have left that we are
aware will most likely never return here as imms are departed.  From doing
some checking on this that means they are either stripped of their mortal
powers and put as mortals OR they have deleted or been fried.  Regardless, we
know they will not be returning here.  Sooooo my understanding of elder is an
imm that left on decent terms that may sign on once in a while and in some
cases may even return as an imm.  Some examples of this are Kenneth when he
came back and personally I woud not mind talking him into coming back to
build again lol, or Vegita who as we all know is back coding for us and we
are very greatful to have him here, Urza who has come and gone and come and
gone and now is apparently due to circumstances beyond his control using an
new name but in Balance, not sure if he signs in often or not but anyway back
to my point.  Some of our elders such as Tarrent we are pretty sure will not
be back, Porthios will most likely not be back ect...  Same goes for Liriel,
Xenith, Jubei and I assume Ebony so is there any reason we keep them as an
imm instead of making them departed?  Liriel for example has not signed on
since September 2, 2002.  So do we expire them after a set period of time or
do we leave them elders forever and ever and ever?  Part 2 of my question is
does it matter?  The only thing I see that may matter is we keep the elders
on the Wizlist and if there are gonna be that many of them maybe we shoud
consider taking them off the wizlist.  Anyway I just wanted to throw that out
there and see what you all thought.

I think that an ex-imm or an imm that hasn't logged in after
a set amount of time (say 6 months or so) should become an Elder.
If they do not return after another year (past the original time)
I think we should remove them entirely.

We only keep mortal player files around for a year...why keep builders, coders, etc around for longer?

Hi gang, You all know I adore each and every one of you.  I would really like
to take the time to let you know where I would like to see us be as
immortals.  Every immortal here including myself would not be here if we were
not trusted.  Now I am not a dreamer therefore I do not have the unrealistic
fantasy that we will never have squables and disagreements.  And yes
sometimes we will get really frustrated with eachother.  HOWEVER I would like
to see us all remember that 1, Immortal issues belong with imms not with the
mortals.  I do not want to see mortals being dragged into personal squables. 
I would love to see us work together and be a strong unit.  Everyone here is
here because they possess a quality that makes them unique to Legacy.  So my
goal is that we all work together and do what we do best.  If anyone has a
problem I would like to see you try to work it out amongst yourselves but if
you cannot Asmadi and I are more than happy to talk.  

So Thank you each for everything you do and have done and will do.  You all

gets easily destracted but I will continue to try and refocus him to cross
mud activities.  Montrey has agreed to be our stabilizer, keeping up on bugs
and cutting down on the amount of down time.  As for Xenith when we talked he
told me plain out he is not sure if he wants to be back to help or not.  That
Monty keeps bugging him.  He said he helps Monty if and when Mont asks for
help.  Monty said that Xenith is more of a shell admin coder.  I left that
alone.  Monty also said he will work closely with Vegita to enhance Vegita's
coding ability and keep us updated on his progress.  I told mont I was going
to keep Vegita concentrating on evolve for now until Monty feels he is ready
for more.  Monty and I had a wonderful conversation.  SO so far so good.  I

I had a very long discussion with Xenith.  He is back as an immortal with
Legacy full force.  He is dedicated to his work here.  I believe part of his
hesitation was fear of committing and having things not work so it was easier
to say he was here for Mont.  So for now, due to all the coders and stability
problems I have asked him to help Monty in keeping the mud up and finding
stability.  He explained his passion for coding to me and I believe what he
has said.  He has shown to be a good coder in the past and I believe he is a
valuable asset for Legacy at this time.  Legacy definently has some flaws in
the codes that we need to get under control..  Example newbies getting imm

Subject Versioning System~
Text
Having not used the subversion program before, I thought it would
be a good idea to read up on it, before commenting either way whether
Legacy should use cvs or subversion.

What I found is that, in debates, some people perfer subversion.
Others perfer cvs, some randomly threw in that bitkeeper is better.
A few even like arch over everything else. So, the polls come out about even there.

Some more reading uncovered that subversion is written and
maintained by the same people who wrote/maintain cvs.
What we have here, in their own view, are two programs
which are designed to do the same thing, with a similar interface
with similar capabilties. The difference?
Subversion is supposed to be better at handling mutiple branches of projects
from which we would not benefit, having only one branch.

My conclusion: I don't think it'll matter which one we use,
they should work, interface and perform the same.
While cvs has some (minor) problems, I do not think it warrents a
move to subversion.
Or to arch, or bitkeeper, or...

The command you are inquiring about, showraff, stands for

You are correct that there was no help for this command
(though help affect) would give you a hint.

I have added a help file for showraff and made the command
a little more user friendly. The changed command should appear in the

Text
I want to broach this subject with you all before I broach it with the
mortals.  SOE has a really different way of censor that you all should take
the time to check out.  Anyway it kinda conflicts with our current censor . 
My thought is this...  I think that maybe it would be a good idea to conform
with their censor code.  What I want to know is how you all think about that.
Basically in a nutshell they can say what ever they want on any channel .. 
They don't have a flame..  If you are rated r you would see the real words
used...  But if you were rated g you would see different words..  Example
shit and crud.  I do however feel if we take this on we would need to add
racial and sexual slurs because legacy has had some problems and complaints
about the use of them in the past.  

I am gonna leave this up for discussion until Monday then I am going to
present it to our mortals and let them have input before we all come to a
conclusion.  Please put your 2 cents in because we all should be happy with
the world we are in ...  Imms and Mortals.

Censorship is a touchy subject which I think we're going to take flak for..from both sides.
I'm going to approach my response on how I feel about this (A) personally and (B) proffessionally.

A) Personally, I am against censorship. If people don't like the subject matter discussed on remote channels, it is fairly easy to block all remote text.
The same goes for most channels. If one doesn't like them, they can be blocked. I think this is our best and first weapon against inappropriate messages.
I know it's harsh, but I think people are used to (or should be used to) most of what people around here throw around.
Most of our players are mild-mouthed and I thik we owe them the repect to say what they wish without changing their messages.

B) On a more business-like note, it would be impossible to catch all racial, sexual or poor-taste messages. It just can't be done.
Consider the word fck or bytch. It's going to get through. Or even f u c, k will get through most censors.
My point is that we have some simple censors in place to catch random messages. However, if people _want_ to use improper language here, the only cure is an imm.

With that out of the way, I think our time would be better spent trying to keep an imm all most of the time and checking convo logs when they aren't....or even just waiting for a complaint.
If we respond quickly and harshly to any complaints, I'm sure everyone''s virgin ears will be kept clean.

So, to sum up: Time spent coding censorship bad. Clear rules and firm application good.

i use tortoise cvs on my computer, in which i check out a working copy of
the src to my winxp comp.  when i make changes, i commit, just like any cvs
setup, except the problem is that i can't test locally.  i've had crazy
amounts of problems trying to configure cygwin on my computer in the past,
and would rather not mess with it.  but, there is a solution, since i can't
afford to set up a separate computer as a linux box, and i really don't
want to dual boot.  as you pointed out, one of the distinguishing features
of SVN from CVS is working with multiple project branches.  if we were to
change over to svn, i would simply branch the repository when i'm working
on something more significant than a typo fix, and then when i'm finished
with all my stuff and have the branch compilable and debugged, i'd merge
it back into the main repository.

also, just in case anyone is wondering, the learning curve of switching from
cvs to svn if you haven't used svn is very slight.  the common commands are
nearly identical, just replace 'cvs' with 'svn' in command line use.
plus when you update you get to type 'svn up' (yes, i'm easily amused)

Subject It Is all Good~
Text
I am sure by now most of you have realized that shell is locked.  Please do
not get excited this is a good thing.  Asmadi and I had a wonderful
discussion tonight and have some Great plans to present to you as to how we
would like to proceed with coding projects.  As we all know change is
inevitable in life and this is one of those times.  I will ask you all to sit
back and read the plan before jumping .  Please take time to let it sink in
before you respond.  

That being said, as you all know we have had a lot of down time lately.  Part
of this we believe may be the fact that we are fortunate enough to have so
many wonderful coders.  However, we needed to come up with a plan as to how
to cut our down time and increase our stability.  What is in the paragraphs
to come is what we have devised as our plan of action and we sincerely hope
you all agree.  First all projects will be requested in writing to myself and
your fellow coders before any work is done.  This is a multi part function. 
We have come up with 3 different sinerios in which each assignment will fall.
We are calling it our 1-2-3 plan.  When you note you will include what you
are coding, the severity of the code (which I will explain momentarily) and
what file you will be using to work on that code.  Severity will be 1, 2 or
3.  Lets start with 1.  A 1 severity is a simple change, or easy change that
only needs to be tested for one day before you can announce it as complete. 
That would include something simple such as text.  Severity 2 would be
somethings such as a spell which would need to be tested for 3 days before it
would be announced as complete.  And Severity 3 would include the more
difficult tasks such as writing new code which would have to be tested and
proven stable for 1 week before anounced completed.  So lets give you an
example.  I want to add more cross mud socials.  My note would say I would
like to add more cross mud socials.  I believe it will be a level 2
difficulty and will only require me to write 2 new functions, not alter any
existing ones, and will only use act_comm.  C file.  

Ok from there you will need to wait a day to get my approval.  This will give
your co-coders a chance to comment or make suggestions and will give me a
chance to accept or deny the request.  You may ONLY work on {COne{x code at a
time.  Also any deviations from the initial requet must be resubmitted and
approved.  While your code is being tested is the time to submit your next
request however it will not be approved until the one in testing is finished
testing and announced complete.  

How is this going to happen you ask.  Well the test port is to remain open at
all times.  It is not to be shut down by anyone for any reason.  That is
where all your work will be done.  When Asmadi or I are sure it is a safe
time we will do a copyover.  Noone else is to copyover on port 3000 for any
reason.  Now I know this sounds like a lot to digest and it is.  But if you
really sit back and think about it the stability of Legacy will keep us
players.  A mud that is constantly down does not keep players.  

Any coder that does NOT know how to test without committing needs to note
Asmadi immediately so he can go over the process with you.  Asmadi and I want
to keep each and every one of you .  You are all very valuable to us.  We are
hoping to have your complete cooperation in this change.  We encourage you to
note us with your replys.  

A note on shell password is to follow.  Thank you for your time and patience.

Subject Shell Password~
Text
Ok as you all know the password in shell was changed.  This is not a negative
thing and is not aimed at anyone.  But there are a few reasons we are doing
this and a few things that need to be cleared up before we hand out the new
password.  

In order to get the new password you must agree to the following in writing
via note to Asmadi and I.  1) All code belongs to legacy and should be used
for legacy purposes only.  If you want to use it for any other reason you
must get prior authorization in writing from Asmadi.  2) You must agree to
the previous note about how we plan on conducting coding from here on out. 
3) NOBODY is to give out the shell password to anyone else other than Asmadi
and Myself.  We are trying to moniter who has access to the shell at all
times.  If for some reason you feel someone needs shell please ask for prior
authorization and wait for an approval or denial from one of us.  

I know you all will agree that your work as well as the work of your fellow
imms should be protected at all times.  We all put countless number of hours
into Legacy and we do not want to see that go by the wasteside.  4) Noone is
to keep a backup of Legacy on their hard drive.  If you need a file..  Take
the file..  Then return it to shell and delete it from your hard drive after
it has been tested and implimented.  

I am sure that you are all here for the same reason to protect and improve
Legacy and to see that the best thing for Legacy is what is done.  If Asmadi
and I did not believe that then you would not be here.  So as I stated before
once we have a note from you agreeing to the terms listed we will issue you
the password.  If any of you have a problem or concern with the terms listed
please feel free to note Asmadi and I so we can discuss it further.  

Thank you for your time and cooperation,

so if we have a bug that crashes the mud, one of us writes a note saying we
want to try and find it, wait a day for approval, if we get approved we
then download all 2 megs of the source code since we pretty much have to
have the entire thing available to us to do *anything* (which, by the way,
takes a while because some of us are cursed with dial up), then when we
find it we submit, wait a day for it to be tested, and in the meantime we
just crash?

four things that i need to address.  first off is in reference to my previous
note, what to do if we have a major bug.  the obvious solution, of course, is
just how any software company would handle it.  the users (players) have to
just deal with it until proper procedure is followed and the bug is fixed.  it
is the safest way, although easily the shittiest to the players.

secondly, i will not delete anything i have on my hard drive.  i wrote a rather
large portion of legacy, i have personally modified nearly every single source
file, with the exception of outsider's stuff and a few files like ansi_compat.h.
i keep my copy current, i make frequent backups of my hard drive, and before i
mess with *any* kind of coding project i plan out what i need to do using the
source files as reference.  when i need to look up how something works, i do it.
i don't do it in shell because pico blows, and all other unix editors blow
harder.  so, if i'm not trusted to keep my copy of the code to myself, so be it.

thirdly, i fully understand the need for organization of projects.  i have no
problem at all keeping you, teo, or anyone else appraised of what i'm working on,
with the exception of small bug fixes.  if something is on the bug list, i just
do it, and it'll be made into a change note to inform everyone else, even though
most people either didn't know it existed or didn't care.  but for anything more
major than that, of course i can keep the imms informed.  if someone has a
problem with what i'm working on, then i need to be told.  but i think this only
applies to changes that are visible, or have an effect on game balance.  if i
need to add a unique index to the pc_data mysql table and change INSERTs and
REPLACEs into REPLACE INTOs, why do i need to ask permission to do it?  would
anyone understand what i'm talking about?  what about if i'm adjusting the block
sizes on the semiperm string hash table?  to ask permission is to presume that
anyone alive knows legacy's source code better than me.  this is not an ego
issue.  i simply do not have the time or the patience to explain most of the
changes i do, since most of them are behind the scenes.

finally, we don't even have enough memory available for the mud and it's related
processes, the sand server, startup script, and mysql connection.  kyndig said
that our problems with the mysql server connection were due to timeout, but it
came a little late because i had already put in something to ping the server
every 20 seconds. (a mysql connection times out after 8 hours of inactivity)
i'm almost positive that the server has some kind of script running to kill
processes when we're over our memory limit.  the evidence can be seen when we
try to run spawn at all.  usually it receives SIGKILL after about 30 seconds of
being up.  in order to run spawn at all, we need about 40 megs of ram, 45
preferably to be on the safe side.  i'm not sure what it costs, but it's what
is needed.

Text
Mont, I feel the need to express some concerns regarding our conversation the
other night and the note you wrote me and Asmadi.  I was obvously very laid
back when we were talking and I want to tell you why.  In all honesty you
floored me with your comments.  Yes you were a founder of Legacy, and yes you
put a lot of work and money and time in while you were here.  That was a year
and a half ago that you left and went to Dizzy.  Since you left I have had
some wonderful coders help me along the way.  Legacy now is NOT primarly your
code.  It is a mixture of your code and Viro, Nylan, Geralt, Vegita, Xenith
and very much a lot of Outsider.  To come at us like this is still your mud
is just wrong.  Now I am sure you are regret handing it over to me at this
point but you did.  And with the help of some wonderful people I have been
trudging along.  You said something to me the other day which is what I think
the bottom line is, you said you are so use to being the head coder.  I know
that this is a blow to your ego but as much as you are a fantastic coder and
we appreciate your help legacy and SOE are going to go on and move forward
with or without you.  Now, to say that you know better than us regarding
Legacy is just plain out disrespectful.  Asmadi and I have been working hard
to improve Legacy and we have both put a lot of money and time in here also. 
At this stage in the game I am questioning all I have ever known about you
also.  I am having a real hard time putting my trust in you when you can not
put your trust in me.  Trust is a two way streat.  Now Asmadi and I laid out
what we are looking for and what we expect from our coders.  Weather you
believe it or not and weather you agree to it or not is up to you.  But
please if you do stay try to keep in mind that Asmadi and I are not brainless
twits and please refrain from treating us or talking to us as such.  

I really hope we can work this out and find a way to all be happy.  As I
stated before you are a wonderful coder, I just don't think that gives you
the room to attempt to walk on me or anyone else.

Text
I am sure by now most of you have realized that shell is locked.  Please do
not get excited this is a good thing.  Asmadi and I had a wonderful
discussion tonight and have some Great plans to present to you as to how we
would like to proceed with coding projects.  As we all know change is
inevitable in life and this is one of those times.  I will ask you all to sit
back and read the plan before jumping .  Please take time to let it sink in
before you respond.  

That being said, as you all know we have had a lot of down time lately.  Part
of this we believe may be the fact that we are fortunate enough to have so
many wonderful coders.  However, we needed to come up with a plan as to how
to cut our down time and increase our stability.  What is in the paragraphs
to come is what we have devised as our plan of action and we sincerely hope
you all agree.  First all projects will be requested in writing to myself and
your fellow coders before any work is done.  This is a multi part function. 
We have come up with 3 different sinerios in which each assignment will fall.
We are calling it our 1-2-3 plan.  When you note you will include what you
are coding, the severity of the code (which I will explain momentarily) and
what file you will be using to work on that code.  Severity will be 1, 2 or
3.  Lets start with 1.  A 1 severity is a simple change, or easy change that
only needs to be tested for one day before you can announce it as complete. 
That would include something simple such as text.  Severity 2 would be
somethings such as a spell which would need to be tested for 3 days before it
would be announced as complete.  And Severity 3 would include the more
difficult tasks such as writing new code which would have to be tested and
proven stable for 1 week before anounced completed.  So lets give you an
example.  I want to add more cross mud socials.  My note would say I would
like to add more cross mud socials.  I believe it will be a level 2
difficulty and will only require me to write 2 new functions, not alter any
existing ones, and will only use act_comm.  C file.  

Ok from there you will need to wait a day to get my approval.  This will give
your co-coders a chance to comment or make suggestions and will give me a
chance to accept or deny the request.  You may ONLY work on {COne{x code at a
time.  Also any deviations from the initial requet must be resubmitted and
approved.  While your code is being tested is the time to submit your next
request however it will not be approved until the one in testing is finished
testing and announced complete.  

How is this going to happen you ask.  Well the test port is to remain open at
all times.  It is not to be shut down by anyone for any reason.  That is
where all your work will be done.  When Asmadi or I are sure it is a safe
time we will do a copyover.  Noone else is to copyover on port 3000 for any
reason.  Now I know this sounds like a lot to digest and it is.  But if you
really sit back and think about it the stability of Legacy will keep us
players.  A mud that is constantly down does not keep players.  

Any coder that does NOT know how to test without committing needs to note
Asmadi immediately so he can go over the process with you.  Asmadi and I want
to keep each and every one of you .  You are all very valuable to us.  We are
hoping to have your complete cooperation in this change.  We encourage you to
note us with your replys.  

A note on shell password is to follow.  Thank you for your time and patience.

Text
Ok as you all know the password in shell was changed.  This is not a negative
thing and is not aimed at anyone.  But there are a few reasons we are doing
this and a few things that need to be cleared up before we hand out the new
password.  

In order to get the new password you must agree to the following in writing
via note to Asmadi and I.  1) All code belongs to legacy and should be used
for legacy purposes only.  If you want to use it for any other reason you
must get prior authorization in writing from Asmadi.  2) You must agree to
the previous note about how we plan on conducting coding from here on out. 
3) NOBODY is to give out the shell password to anyone else other than Asmadi
and Myself.  We are trying to moniter who has access to the shell at all
times.  If for some reason you feel someone needs shell please ask for prior
authorization and wait for an approval or denial from one of us.  

I know you all will agree that your work as well as the work of your fellow
imms should be protected at all times.  We all put countless number of hours
into Legacy and we do not want to see that go by the wasteside.  4) Noone is
to keep a backup of Legacy on their hard drive.  If you need a file..  Take
the file..  Then return it to shell and delete it from your hard drive after
it has been tested and implimented.  

I am sure that you are all here for the same reason to protect and improve
Legacy and to see that the best thing for Legacy is what is done.  If Asmadi
and I did not believe that then you would not be here.  So as I stated before
once we have a note from you agreeing to the terms listed we will issue you
the password.  If any of you have a problem or concern with the terms listed
please feel free to note Asmadi and I so we can discuss it further.  

Thank you for your time and cooperation,

alright, first off, i owe you guys an apology.  i wrote the previous note
while angry, i should have taken some time to cool off and think about it
first.  most of it *was* just ego talking.  so, i'm sorry for that, and
now i'll try to take a more sensible approach.  as i pointed out, i've
been the head coder everywhere i've worked for a long time.  that actually
wasn't meant to imply 'i know it all, i have to be in charge'.  what it
meant was that my coding style and practices have developed with me
typically being the *only* person coding, where i don't have to worry about
stepping on other people's toes when i need to change something.  so, i'm
going to have to adapt, and so far i'm having a difficult time of it.  i
will get used to it, though.

first off, the permission on projects.  yes, i can deal with that.  it
makes sense.  if i need to work on something technical, i'll submit it as
such, and explain more if asked.  but, i do have an idea for something to
help make it easier for everyone, i'll post it in a note following this.

as far as having copies of the mud, i'm perfectly fine with it as long as
it doesn't apply to coders having a copy of the source.  i can't speak for
everyone else, but i personally open a lot of files when i code something,
most of which aren't changed.  they're just for reference, i.e. when i need
to see how a function i'm calling works, or i need to look up a variable
name, etc.  i can't be online a lot, so i need to keep a local copy rather
than fetching a file when i need it.

the only problem i have right now is stating in a request to make a change
what files i'll need to work on.  that's really what cvs is for.  it makes
a log of what files are changed, and it prevents us from making changes to
the same line of the same file by two different people (it'll request us to
merge the conflicts, easily done).  on a bug fix it can be relatively easy,
provided it's simple.  like, if there's a bug with something, i may request
to fix it, thinking that it'll be a simple fix in one file, but it may turn
into a more major thing because the original coding is bad.  i really believe
that having to request permission to change more files to fulfill the goal
that we've been approved for will only slow down our work with no real
benefit.  i'd be more than happy to post a list of the changed files *after*
i get done fixing and before i request a copyover, i'd simply cut and paste
the commit log.  or, better yet, i'd stick whoever wants to know on the cvs
commit mailing list.

so... i guess that's it.  the problem above i'd like to discuss further,
but it can wait, for the moment i can deal with it.  this is my letter of
acceptance of the new system, i agree to abide by the guidelines laid out
for coders.  now can i get to work on these crash bugs? :)

Subject project stuff~
Text
ok, this is the first project i'd like to work on.  it is designed to help
us manage the projects that have been requested, or are underway, or have
been implemented.  i feel that requesting projects by note will be hard to
manage, and get spammy, and things will get lost and we'll waste a lot of
time trying to do it.  so, here's the outline:

we retain our text files like bug, typo, ridea, work, etc.  these help to
keep track of stuff that needs to be worked on.  we would get rid of two
files, hbi and hbb.  (this project system could be adapted to builders
very easily)  what would happen is this:  there would be a command called
'project', available to all imms.  to start the process, the coder or
builder would type 'project request (name of project)'.

project request:
to start the process, the coder or builder would type
'project request (name of project)'.  this would make a new entry to the
project list, showing their name, name of the project, date requested,
and stage of completion, maybe like this:
{x   [1] [R] [Montrey] [12/20/04] new project management system
the 'R' stands for 'requested'.  there would be a few codes that can go
here, like 'G' for 'granted', 'C' for 'completed', and 'I' for 'implemented'.
of course, easy to look at and stuff, some use of colors.  the '1' is just
the number of the project, for use in referring to it, as described below.

project define:
after creating a new project with 'project request', the person would use
'project define' to make an explanation.  example:
{x   project define 1 + this is the first line of the explanation.  if i want
{x   project define 1 + to make more lines, i just do it like this.  if i
{x   project define 1 + wanted to erase lines, i'd just use '-'.
just like fingerinfo stuff.  you could only add definitions to *your*
projects.  this isn't meant to be a discussion panel, just as a quick
reference in case the project name isn't detailed enough.

after that, the project is awaiting approval.  when an imm logs on, they
get right beneath notes:
{x   Montrey has 2 projects awaiting approval.
{x   Vegita has 439 projects awaiting approval.
*duck vegita*  anyway, that would display to all imms, so that everyone can
see what has been requested.  to see them, people would use the following

project list:
just project list by itself would give a list of all projects and their
completion status, laid out in lines like
{x   [1] [R] [Montrey] [12/20/04] new project management system
{x   [2] [A] [ Vegita] [12/19/04] evolved smokescreen
they could also use things like the person's name or 'complete' or 'request'
to see projects by that person or meeting that completion status.  or, they
could use 'project define (number)' as in the above command to see the
definition for that project.  as said above, only the person who requested
the project could change the definition, but the same command would be used
to see the definition.

project approve:
once the project has gone through the discussion phase, teo or asmadi would
then use 'project approve (number)' to give their approval on the project.
it can be seen in the 'A' in vegita's project, above.  when the person who
requested the project logged on, they would see:
{x   You have 2 new projects that have been approved.
{x   Montrey has 1 new project that has been approved.
after that, permission has been granted, time to get to work.

project complete:
when the coder or builder has finished doing their changes, they would use:
'project complete (number)' to signify that it is now ready for testing.

project tested:
after the testing phase if finished, the coder or builder uses 'project
tested (number)' to let the imps know that it is ready to put in.  after
that, imms get a message when they log on like:
{x   Montrey has 2 new projects that are ready to be implemented.
then, teo or asmadi would update the main src, compile, and copyover the
mud.  then, they would use

project implemented:
'project implemented (number)' for the final phase of the project.  the
project would then only show on the list when it is not spammed off by other
newer projects.  imms logging on would see:
{x   Montrey has 1 new project that has been implemented.

and that's it :)  input?

I like the idea too, it was similar to something I was trying to think up. 
As far as detailing the files you are going to use...  It would be a good
idea to atleast give a quick idea of the files you believe might be changed. 
This would allow other coders the ability to atleast avoid conflicts ahead of
time.  I'm glad we can open the doors of communication and work for a
resolution.  I'd ideally like to sit down and more throughly detail a new
management system with all of us so we can make sure we correct any anomolies
ahead of time.  At this point...  Once Teo has given the Ok, we can move
ahead on this project management stuff.  I think it's critical for us all to
work as smoothly as feasible.  
It's truly a learning curve for us all.

I am sure by now most of you have realized that shell is locked.  Please do
not get excited this is a good thing.  Asmadi and I had a wonderful
discussion tonight and have some Great plans to present to you as to how we
would like to proceed with coding projects.  As we all know change is
inevitable in life and this is one of those times.  I will ask you all to sit
back and read the plan before jumping .  Please take time to let it sink in
before you respond.  

That being said, as you all know we have had a lot of down time lately.  Part
of this we believe may be the fact that we are fortunate enough to have so
many wonderful coders.  However, we needed to come up with a plan as to how
to cut our down time and increase our stability.  What is in the paragraphs
to come is what we have devised as our plan of action and we sincerely hope
you all agree.  First all projects will be requested in writing to myself and
your fellow coders before any work is done.  This is a multi part function. 
We have come up with 3 different sinerios in which each assignment will fall.
We are calling it our 1-2-3 plan.  When you note you will include what you
are coding, the severity of the code (which I will explain momentarily) and
what file you will be using to work on that code.  Severity will be 1, 2 or
3.  Lets start with 1.  A 1 severity is a simple change, or easy change that
only needs to be tested for one day before you can announce it as complete. 
That would include something simple such as text.  Severity 2 would be
somethings such as a spell which would need to be tested for 3 days before it
would be announced as complete.  And Severity 3 would include the more
difficult tasks such as writing new code which would have to be tested and
proven stable for 1 week before anounced completed.  So lets give you an
example.  I want to add more cross mud socials.  My note would say I would
like to add more cross mud socials.  I believe it will be a level 2
difficulty and will only require me to write 2 new functions, not alter any
existing ones, and will only use act_comm.  C file.  

Ok from there you will need to wait a day to get my approval.  This will give
your co-coders a chance to comment or make suggestions and will give me a
chance to accept or deny the request.  You may ONLY work on {COne{x code at a
time.  Also any deviations from the initial requet must be resubmitted and
approved.  While your code is being tested is the time to submit your next
request however it will not be approved until the one in testing is finished
testing and announced complete.  

How is this going to happen you ask.  Well the test port is to remain open at
all times.  It is not to be shut down by anyone for any reason.  That is
where all your work will be done.  When Asmadi or I are sure it is a safe
time we will do a copyover.  Noone else is to copyover on port 3000 for any
reason.  Now I know this sounds like a lot to digest and it is.  But if you
really sit back and think about it the stability of Legacy will keep us
players.  A mud that is constantly down does not keep players.  

Any coder that does NOT know how to test without committing needs to note
Asmadi immediately so he can go over the process with you.  Asmadi and I want
to keep each and every one of you .  You are all very valuable to us.  We are
hoping to have your complete cooperation in this change.  We encourage you to
note us with your replys.  

A note on shell password is to follow.  Thank you for your time and patience.

Ok as you all know the password in shell was changed.  This is not a negative
thing and is not aimed at anyone.  But there are a few reasons we are doing
this and a few things that need to be cleared up before we hand out the new
password.  

In order to get the new password you must agree to the following in writing
via note to Asmadi and I.  1) All code belongs to legacy and should be used
for legacy purposes only.  If you want to use it for any other reason you
must get prior authorization in writing from Asmadi.  2) You must agree to
the previous note about how we plan on conducting coding from here on out. 
3) NOBODY is to give out the shell password to anyone else other than Asmadi
and Myself.  We are trying to moniter who has access to the shell at all
times.  If for some reason you feel someone needs shell please ask for prior
authorization and wait for an approval or denial from one of us.  

I know you all will agree that your work as well as the work of your fellow
imms should be protected at all times.  We all put countless number of hours
into Legacy and we do not want to see that go by the wasteside.  4) Noone is
to keep a backup of Legacy on their hard drive.  If you need a file..  Take
the file..  Then return it to shell and delete it from your hard drive after
it has been tested and implimented.  

I am sure that you are all here for the same reason to protect and improve
Legacy and to see that the best thing for Legacy is what is done.  If Asmadi
and I did not believe that then you would not be here.  So as I stated before
once we have a note from you agreeing to the terms listed we will issue you
the password.  If any of you have a problem or concern with the terms listed
please feel free to note Asmadi and I so we can discuss it further.

Subject Program Process Improvement~
Text
This entire system with multiple coders will take some time to thoroughly
refine, as such I'll propose my first change to our system.  When a crash bug
is identified, any coder can go and attempt to fix the bug immediately after
posting a note quickly alerting the other coders they are working on it. 
Also a followup note once the fix is made should be posted detailing the
cause and fix for the bug.  Once one coder has identified that they are
fixing the bug, no other coder should manipulate the code to fix the bug. 
The copyover will be handled by Teo or myself, or in the event we are not
here you may take the steps needed to remedy the situation.  
Please let me know if there are any concerns with this idea/process change,
Asmadi

For the last time, you *can't* remove all command groups from the players.
Removing the 'clan' group will do exactly what Teo and Fedora are reporting.
Player groups are Player, Clan, Avatar, and Hero. (depending on level and clan)
The problem with players being able to see immortal notes/chat/etc is because they
have the Security command group. That is the *only* one you need to remove.
If you remove the rest, they get screwed up. So Asmadi, you need to remove or change
your fix to only remove the security group. (which is probably bit 5)

Text
I am sure by now most of you have realized that shell is locked.  Please do
not get excited this is a good thing.  Asmadi and I had a wonderful
discussion tonight and have some Great plans to present to you as to how we
would like to proceed with coding projects.  As we all know change is
inevitable in life and this is one of those times.  I will ask you all to sit
back and read the plan before jumping .  Please take time to let it sink in
before you respond.  

That being said, as you all know we have had a lot of down time lately.  Part
of this we believe may be the fact that we are fortunate enough to have so
many wonderful coders.  However, we needed to come up with a plan as to how
to cut our down time and increase our stability.  What is in the paragraphs
to come is what we have devised as our plan of action and we sincerely hope
you all agree.  First all projects will be requested in writing to myself and
your fellow coders before any work is done.  This is a multi part function. 
We have come up with 3 different sinerios in which each assignment will fall.
We are calling it our 1-2-3 plan.  When you note you will include what you
are coding, the severity of the code (which I will explain momentarily) and
what file you will be using to work on that code.  Severity will be 1, 2 or
3.  Lets start with 1.  A 1 severity is a simple change, or easy change that
only needs to be tested for one day before you can announce it as complete. 
That would include something simple such as text.  Severity 2 would be
somethings such as a spell which would need to be tested for 3 days before it
would be announced as complete.  And Severity 3 would include the more
difficult tasks such as writing new code which would have to be tested and
proven stable for 1 week before anounced completed.  So lets give you an
example.  I want to add more cross mud socials.  My note would say I would
like to add more cross mud socials.  I believe it will be a level 2
difficulty and will only require me to write 2 new functions, not alter any
existing ones, and will only use act_comm.  C file.  

Ok from there you will need to wait a day to get my approval.  This will give
your co-coders a chance to comment or make suggestions and will give me a
chance to accept or deny the request.  You may ONLY work on {COne{x code at a
time.  Also any deviations from the initial requet must be resubmitted and
approved.  While your code is being tested is the time to submit your next
request however it will not be approved until the one in testing is finished
testing and announced complete.  

How is this going to happen you ask.  Well the test port is to remain open at
all times.  It is not to be shut down by anyone for any reason.  That is
where all your work will be done.  When Asmadi or I are sure it is a safe
time we will do a copyover.  Noone else is to copyover on port 3000 for any
reason.  Now I know this sounds like a lot to digest and it is.  But if you
really sit back and think about it the stability of Legacy will keep us
players.  A mud that is constantly down does not keep players.  

Any coder that does NOT know how to test without committing needs to note
Asmadi immediately so he can go over the process with you.  Asmadi and I want
to keep each and every one of you .  You are all very valuable to us.  We are
hoping to have your complete cooperation in this change.  We encourage you to
note us with your replys.  

A note on shell password is to follow.  Thank you for your time and patience.


Humbly yours,
Teotwawki

Subject Bug Fixes~
Text
I would like to propose a project.
On and off for the past year I have been hunting down memory
leaks, seg faults and exit() calls in Legacy's code.
I think I've close to being finished (especially with the exit calls) and
I would like permission to hunt down and fix the last of these errors.

This would probably be a level 2 job, taking a day or two to find all the bugs.
Due to their nature, they would be hard to test, as they are only triggered by massive memory use or long uptime.
What I am doing, in percise terms, is finding memory allocation calls that
are not followed by checks to see if the call was sucessful or not.
I add a check and, if the check fails, an error message to help us track down future bugs.

I get the impression that you just performed a copyover, rather than copying my changes into place and then performing a copyover.

The running version of Legacy is /home/legacy/legacy/src/legacy
I have also commited my changes to cvs in the case you wish to re-compile Legacy yourself before making the switch.

I did not replace the current Legacy binary because we still experience crashes and a reboot would have been the same as me doing the copyover.

Once your project goes into the testing phase, feel free to shut down the
current running version of the tp assuming no one else is testing...  And run
your version of legacy as the tp on port 3001.  Once you obtain the required
uptime for the tp with your code changes...  Feel free to get authorization
to commit to the main code.  After it is commited, teo or myself will update
the live program and perform a copyover once each week.  Just wanted to clear

subject Uptime
Since most of our changes involve players and since most players don't log in to port 3001, doesn't the uptime of the test program seem unimportant?
I agree that if it crashes inside five minutes, that's a bad sign. However, if it doesn't crash after five minutes, it's not likely to crash (without stress testing) after a week.

Also: Anyone else testing right now?

Subject Crash From Memory Error~
Text
As some of you have notcied in the past few days, we've been crashing from calloc() calls.
This only seems to happen in the Write_To_Server function (which makes sense, since it's one of the few places that uses calloc.
My temporary solution is to comment out the calloc call and set aside a large amount of space on the stack. This makes the code, in my opinion, less flexible, but it should avoid the calloc issue.
So we're trading some efficentcy for Just Works.

Since we're not able to connect to the Chat server at the moment, I'm going to put this aside for now. The only altered code is my copy of chit.c (/home/legacy/outsider/src/chit.c)

Subject Testing new Code~
Text
Okay, I'm brain storming here...
1. WE want to make sure Legacy keeps good uptimes. So new versions should be able to stay up for long periods of time.
2. We should be able to test specific changes, like certain command output, etc.
3. Many of our current issues take a while before they show up.

I have been running my test programs from screen and checking back in on it. That way I see any output without logfiles. this has the added bonus of showing my why the program died (like segfault).

Perhaps a test program is in order, like they use in extreme coding. A program that would log in as a player and perform random commands (and LOTS of 'em) for several hours.
If the game crashes or bad output is returned, the test client can log it.
Most of us have a test ALT (I assume) so the test program could be setup to login as them, perform some commands and logout again...repeat N times...

Thoughts?

We crashed this morning because a file that wasn't open was being closed.
This was happening in the save.c file where characters and objects are saved/loaded. I did two things to fix this:

1. Set fpReserve (the file handle in question) to NULL when the MUD first starts.

2. Put in checks in all save.c functions to make sure the file was open before closing it.

I would like permission to hunt down other file errors and fix them to avoid similar problems in the future.
I expect this to take a few hours only and should be a level 1 change.

He suggests making the testing system go from 1-4... 1 would be a very simple change like changing a word or color of a channel which would only require loading the testport and testing for like 10 minutes.
A level 2 would be tested for 3 days
A level 3 would be 5 days
and a level 4 would be 7 days.
Also, I'm going to allow him to post a note on switching svn for the coders, this should prevent people from messing up each others code.

i'm not posting this to mortals for reasons which will become clear in a
minute.  first off, i'm fully expecting your first reaction as you read this
to be 'thats insane!'.  but the concept is good, because it's not mine.  wikipedia
does this with excellent results.  what i'm suggesting is that when Porthios
finishes with his helpfile editor, we make it available to *everyone* on the
mud.  players could create or edit helps at will.  by now you're probably ready
to beat me with a hammer, so let me explain.  every help that would be modified
shows up on wiznet when it happens, *and* it shows up in a log of help
changes that we are expected to review often.  that way if they do something
stupid like fill up a help file full of swearing, it won't be around long before
an imm sees it and fixes the problem.  at that point we would also revoke their
note editing priviledges.  the reason for all this is, that notes are a means
of writing down general mud knowledge for other players to use.  since we
seldom have time to do it, and some players get bored so easily, we let them
do it as they feel like it.  we might even award prizes for well written
and useful help files.  also, i was thinking that for every person that logs in,
a message like '2 new helps have been added.' or '5 helps have been changed
since your last visit.'  "help list" might give you a list of recently modified
help files, in fact it would be the same list we imms use to proofread.
as a little bit of incentive, we might also put in a line at the bottom of
the help, 'Last edited by: whoever'.  or if that seems like it might cause
problems, it wouldn't be a big deal to have the mud compare old and new files
when it's editing, and only change the 'last edited' line when there's more than
like, 10% change.  anyway, don't write it off completely, talk to me first
about it :)

I half way agree with this idea.  There are a few issues I have with it
though.  One is we are going to set ourselves up for help files full of
spelling errors.  So am I correct in assuming that we will then have to go in
catch the errors and correct them?  Also who is going to check this log
regularrly?  Sounds to me like that is going to be a full time job in itself.



One other issue I have with it is communicating mis information to the
players.  It is one thing to grant this to say Bigsexy who has been here
forever, or Sturm and let them create helpfiles if they choose but I am not
sure I think this is something that everyone should have access too.  

I am open minded though so I am willing to hear more about this and see what
everybody else thinks.

I think it's a good idea, but maybe something like a permanent newbie message
board instead of actual help files?  I think there should be an official
place morts can go to learn things set up strictly by the imms, and a
seperate place for game tips/tricks offered by fellow mortals.  Mixing the
two may cause lots of confusion for newer players.  Make sense?  If not, find
me and make me explain better...  - Lidda.

Subject Subversion discussion~
Text
Ok, so here's your chance to speak up with your opinions about moving to
subversion.  Basically, the idea is to switch from CVS to subversion for all
the code.  This change requires no effort on your part, as I'll handle the
conversion.  The difference being that you'll use 'svn co' or 'svn commit' or
whatever instead of 'cvs commit'.  It operates in almost the exact same
method.  One of the main benefits is branching.  This would allow you to do
all your work in a branch (for big changes) and be able to commit whenever
you want.  When you are done, the changes would be merged back in to the
'trunk', the core code.  This helps prevent the "stepping on toes" that seems
to be rampent.  Another added bonus is that there is a windows client for
subversion that integrates with windows explorer, so you could checkout the
code to your system and work with it there, and then commit and test, instead
of downloading the file via ftp, editing, then uploading again.  (though I
hear ultraedit makes that easy) There are a bunch of other benefits, such as
less HD space required, etc.  
And now I've lost my train of thought. Any questions, just ask me.
So go ahead and voice your opinions, and Teo will make the final decision.

Subject quest requirements~
Text
Now I will start by saying that nothing is written in stone and everything is
negotiable however this is the only way I have of assureing that quests are
being done.  I am concerned because currently it is not the quest imms that
have been running quests.  You guys are our front line.  I need a few things
from you.  One , I need quest imms to be visible at all times when they are
signed in.  You are not only questors you are our public relations.  Two, I
need you to have one quest night a week where you are committed to certain
times to be on to run quests.  I do not think it is a lot to ask for you to
commit an hour or two of your time to attempt to run quests.  Three, I would
like to see one note quest per week ran by each of you.  So that is really
only 2 things you need to do per week to keep your imm status here.  This is
your opportunity to tell me if you think this is unreasonable.  I am not
saying you can not get sick and inform me you are sick with ____ and will not
be on for a week.  I am saying on average this is what I need to see from you
on a regular basis.  If you cannot handle this small request you may want to
consider stepping down and giving someone else a shot.  Now I know we are
short on mortals right now and quest nights may not be exciting but you can
at least set them up and see if anyone shows up for them and be here if they
do.  
Again I stress this is totally open for discussion , I would like to hear any objections or concerns by next weekend Jan 16th. I also will accept any resignations by that date also.

Humbly yours, 
Teo

I got familiar (well, as familiar as I had to) when we were working on chaos,
and I really liked the system, a lot.  It was easy to use and it was *really*
helpful to the coders which made them happy, and when your coders are happy,
everyone's happy *grins*.  I highly suggest, for what my little ole opinion
is worth, that you guys at least try it.  It's rare that anyone can get me to
change from what I'm used to, (example, CVS).  It's even more rare that I

Ok, for my first project, I wish to remove IS_SPECIAL.  And in the process
fix a few problem commands such as leader and deputize.  This will basically
revert it back to rank checks like it should be.  

Also, I wish to propose adding 8 more mortal levels (making hero level 99)
and making all immortals level 100.  It shouldn't matter in terms of immortal
levels because everything is done with rank checks now.  So I thought it'd be
nice to give the mortals those 8 unsed levels.  


As always, I'm available for clarifications and degredation.

oh yeah, after i posted that, asmadi suggested something like, where all editing
to helps is done and then waits for an imm approval before it actually becomes
visible to other players.  not hard to do, and the imm that is looking over it
could just send it back for more work if it's full of typos or whatever.
also, with that, content could be monitored easily also.  if someone decides
to write a help that just lists a whole bunch of locations for pills, we
might say 'no, people can just go exploring' and reject it.  i didn't really
imagine this as a way for the players to put together an encyclopedia of mud
hints, but a way for them to work on the documentation for commands and features
and concepts that might not have such documention yet

The killall command in the autoboot cron job kills any previous

In fact, if Legacy is still running, the startup script isn't killed anyway.
If a new spawn is being killed it is probably due to an over-use of resources.

Subject bug fix~
Text
i found the bug with command groups, why players keep getting set with
the security group among other things.  there was an old thing in save.c
that would set cgroups to the character 'A' if they were less than 'A',
outdated since cgroups were made into a bitvector.  anyway, 'A' is 41,
and when a player logged on that had 0 command groups, they were given
that.  since 32 is the security group, the mud would see them as having that,
and then add hero, avatar, and clan, thinking they were an imm.  it's hard
to really describe without detailing how command groups work, how they used
to work, and how it was changed over a couple of months ago, so i'll just
leave it at 'this is the problem'.  easy fix, 30 seconds testing, although
i can leave it up on the test port overnight and watch nothing happen while
players keep logging on with the security group, hero commands, clan stuff,
etc, but i'd rather just get it in so we can avoid any more problems.
i won't be here when anyone gets around to approving, so i'd like to
do this and put it in the running mud tomorrow night.  i think this
qualifies as major bug priority.
