#HELPS

0 BACKGROUND STORY~
Let me sit you down, young traveler, and tell you a tale ...

Long ago, the universe was very different.  Worlds existed only to
themselves, and one such world called as Thera.  It was a thriving
land, and together with its inhabitants, it was the realm known to
all as Dizzy.  Filled with immortals and mortals alike, it thrived
and prospered.  But then one day, it all ended.  Looking back, we can
only guess that another realm had collided with Dizzy, but we still
are not certain.  All we know is that everything as we knew it had
been shattered, and all around us lay the bits and pieces of what was
once our world.  

Somehow, within the utter chaos, a separate, new universe had been
born, and whether by the grace of Lady Luck or Lady Fate, three
individuals stumbled upon it.  They saw what was before their eyes
with crystal clarity, and knew what they had to do.  Slowly, and with
painstaking effort, they took each shard they could find, and shaped
it, melding them together to create a crude imitation of what they
had known before.  

But it was not enough.  For when they finished and glanced around
themselves, only then did they begin to see the potential.  The earth
was new, undisturbed.  The air was fresh, clean.  All around them lay 
silence, but it was not unwelcome.  There was so much that could be.
And so they started anew, breaking apart what they had just made, and
reshaping, creating, drawing upon magicks and energy that even they
did not know existed, until they had tried.  At the end, when it was
finished, all three were exhausted.  But they looked around them, saw
the joy, anguish, love, pain, and happiness that would take place 
in what they had created, and it was worth it.

Slowly, travelers started trickling in, and finding the peaceful, 
open atmosphere to their liking, settled down and stayed.  Many more
came, curious as to this realm where fantasy was reality, where the
world was built into a whole, where mortals and immortals appreciated 
alike, and where each and every traveler such as you will find
something to captivate their interest and might adventure, explore,
or just rest one's weary heart for a while.

For yes, your guess is right ... that realm that I speak of is the
very one you are in right now.  Enjoy your stay at Legacy.

0 RULE RULES~
{gThe {BRules {gof {BL{Ce{Wg{ga{Cc{By{x

These are the rules of Legacy.  They are here to ensure that this mud is
fair and enjoyable for everybody.  As a player of Legacy, you agree not to
break any of the below rules - EVEN IF you do not agree with what they say.
Ignorance is not an excuse, and violation of the rules is an indication
that you do not wish to play, and the immortals will act accordingly.

{Y*{x Harassment of players, especially newbies, in any form is not tolerated.
{Y*{x Do not use clients or triggers to do any of the following:  bot, auto-
  reconnect, or keep your character idle.  If you are suspected of such
  activity and do not respond, your character shall be punished.
{Y*{x Multiple playing and logins is strictly prohibited.  Helping your own 
  characters by ANY method is considered cheating: this includes but is not
  limited to giving gold to your other chars, spelling them, grouping with
  them, weakening mobs, or transferring eq in any way (as in dropping it
  and logging on to an alt to go pick it up).
{Y*{x Spam is rude and disrespectful to everybody else on the mud.  Do not do
  it.  Repeating anything 3 times in quick succession is one way spam will 
  be identified, but not the only way.  Also, conflicts inevitably arise on 
  muds between players.  Please keep it to private channels or tells.
{Y*{x Do not advertise other muds on Legacy.  There are many places to do so,
  such as www.mudconnect.com as well as usenet groups.  Logging on just to
  advertise your own mud is frowned upon everywhere, and will get you a
  quick nochannel.
{Y*{x If you find a bug, please report it, and do not use it.  The immortals 
  will get back to you.  
{Y*{x If you have any questions regarding these rules, ASK THE IMMS!  We will
  be more than happy to answer them.  If you go ahead and do something
  without asking us, do not blame us if you are punished.

Lastly, just because a rule is not posted here does not mean that it is not
cheating.  Anybody found cheating can expect to find the smell of smoke and
a small pile of ashes where their character used to be.

0 IMMORTALS STAFF~
The term "Immortals" (or Imms) refers to the staff of Legacy who work
hard to provide a great mudding experience for you, the player.  The
Imms run the mud, and are here to help you, but please do not ask any
imms to assist you in any way that might interfere with game balance,
for example: killing a mob, gathering EQ, locating objects, etc ... 
Because the Imms have much more power than ordinary mortals, they have 
many more rules they must follow.

If you have a question or concern regarding the game or your character,
you may address it to the Imms - that is what they are here for.  You
can either note to Imms or use the pray channel.  Also, if an Immortal
requests you to do something (or to stop doing something), please obey
them immediately.  An Immortal's word is final in every case.

0 NEWBIE INFO~
Ah! Another mortal, seeking adventure.  You should go through mudschool first,
to gain experience to face the trials outside.  Be sure to practice a weapon
in the guild room, or your stay with us shall be very short indeed.  Type
'equipment' to see what your are wielding, 'spells' to see your spells,
'skills' to see your skills, and 'commands' for a list of commands. Help is
available on most commands and abilities.

Please type 'help rules' to see the Rules of ROM.

0 | PIPE~
Syntax: <{Ycommand{x> {P|{x <{Ycommand{x>

The {Ppipe{x allows you to "{Ystack{x" commands.  You can {Ystack{x as many commands
as you wish  (assuming you do not exceed the maximum input length for
your list of commands).

You can place {Ytwo {Ppipes{x next to each other to nullify the separation
of commands.  Instead, it will just print {Yone{x {P|{x instead of the {P||{x you
typed.	(This is useful for putting {Ppiped{x commands into aliases).

{VFor example{x: {Yn{P|{Yscore{P|{Yw{P|{Yw{P|{Ycast 'blood' self{P|{Ys{P|{Yd{x
~

0 GLOBAL SOCIAL SOCIALS~

Syntax: {Ysocial-command{x
	{Ysocial-command player{x
	{Ysocial-command mobile{x
	{RSOCIAL{x {Ysocial-command{x
	{RSOCIAL{x {Ysocial-command player{x

Socials are commands that describe you, the player, doing some action.
You type one of a large list of these commands and it expands to some
nicely descriptive message.

Example: {Rmakeout liriel{x
   You see:    {GYou steam up the windows with Liriel.{x
   She sees:   {GMontrey steams up the windows with you.  Wow baby.{x
   Others see: {GMontrey's steaming up the windows with Liriel.  *whistle*{x

Most socials will work with or without a subject. E.g. '{Rsmile{x' will
show you smiling happily. '{Rsmile{x {Yplayer{x' will show you smiling at
that player.

If you type {RSOCIAL{x (or {RSOC{x) before one of the social-commands,
your social will be visible to everyone in the game. That's called a
global social.

At last count, Legacy had almost 300 socials to choose from.
Type {RSOCIALS{x if you want to see the list.
If you want to know what they do, try them out!

Type {RHELP MORESOCIALS{x if you want to contribute new socials.
Type {RHELP GLOBAL{x if you wanted to see the HELP on {RSOCIAL{x.

0 ROOMS  AREA  BUILDING~
Our goal is to make {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x one of the best MUDs you will ever find.  Our
uniqueness manifests in many ways, one of which is allowing players {Yof
level 35 and up{x to have their own personal room complete with one mob and
3 objects.  It is {Y100 quest points{x if your room is open to all, or
{Y200 quest points{x if it is closed/private. You will need to work out all
the details listed below.  Clan rooms are {Y50 quest points{x, and are always
open to the entire clan.

1. {PName{x of the room, general {Pdescription{x of the room, and
   type of room ({Psafe{x, {Pnorecall{x, etc).

2. Location of the room (which {Parea{x), {Pwhat existing room{x it is to
   be connected to, {Pin which direction{x, and by what type of door
   ({Pno door{x, {Ppass door only{x, etc).

3. {YOne mobile{x and {Y3 objects{x ({Pfurniture/{Pbed{x, {Pfountain{x/{Pdrink{x,
   {Ppill{x/{Ppotion{x/{Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x), subject to the following restrictions:

   The {Pbed{x will be {P150/150 regen rate{x. The {Ppill{x/{Ppotion{x is {Ylevel 15{x,
   with {Yfour level 15 spells{x. The {CIMP{x reserves the right to restrict all
   spells on objects.  The {Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x level may be {Yno lower than level 15{x,
   with 3 charges of a spell {Yno higher than level 25{x.
   -The {Pwand{x/{Pscroll{x can also be a {Pfountain{x or another object, at the sole
    discretion of the {Cbuilders{x.

Due to {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x's EPA regulations, we can only allow one personal room
per player, and since we have become more aware of protecting our
environment, no portals are allowed in personal rooms. This ruling is
because there are several portals already established and maintained.

When you have completed all descriptions for room, mob, and objects,
submit it by {Pemail{V(preferably){x or by {Pnote{V(not recommended){x to the {Cbuilders{x,
or the {PI{Ym{Gp{Bl{Ve{Pm{Ye{Gn{Bt{Vo{Pr{x, who will check it and give it
to a {Cbuilder{x to code. Once your room is submitted and approved, it cannot be
changed (except for typos/bugs). Make sure it is {Y*exactly*{x the way you want it.
The {Cbuilders{x at Legacy are extremely helpful and will advise you if you run
into a problem.

0 DUEL ARENA DUELS CHALLENGE~
Syntax:
{V   duel issue {x<{Yplayer{x> <{Yname of arena{x>
{V   duel accept{x
{V   duel decline{x
{V   duel ignore{x
{V   duel view{x
{V   duel arena{x
{V   duel arena {x<{Yname{x>

For some, disagreements can only be solved through a fight to
the death.  Others may enjoy combat just to test their skill.
For both, there is the duel arena, letting players challenge
eachother to a one on one fight, without interference of any
kind.  Only the supplies you bring and your wits can help you
once you've committed to a duel, as only one person will leave
alive.

Duels are held in exotic locations set aside as battlegrounds,
each provides their own strategic obstacles that you can use
to your advantage, if you know how.  Use {Cduel arena{x to see a
list of the possible arenas, and {Cduel arena {x<{Yname of arena{x>
to learn more about it.

To challenge someone to combat, use {Cduel issue {x<{Yname of player{x>.
Leaving out the name of an arena will cause a random one to be
picked.  There are some restrictions, however.  Players cannot
duel until they are at least level 10, and the challenger and
defender must be within 10 levels of eathother if their clans
are at war.  If one does not wish to take part in duels at all,
they may use {Cduel ignore{x to make themselves unchallengable.

When a person is challenged, they have ten minutes to either
{Cduel decline {xor {Cduel accept{x, or the challenge will expire.
Nothing bad can happen if the duel expires or is declined, except
perhaps a few taunts.

Once a duel is accepted, both parties are transported to separate
preparation rooms to get ready for the upcoming fight.  The
opponents are spelled down, except for their equipment and racial
abilities, and then have 60 seconds to do whatever they need to
prepare.  Once this timer runs out, both are taken to the arena
and battle may begin at any time.

At any time after a duel is accepted, players that are not
involved may {Cduel view{x to be taken to a special viewing room to
watch the battle.  When a battle is finished, the opponents will
find themselves taken back to their clanhalls or the Temple Altar.

0 JUKEBOX PLAY~
Syntax:
   {VPlay{x <{Ysongname{x>
   {VPlay list{x

{VPlay <{Ysongname{x> will do just that: play the song.

These commands will help you interface with the numerous jukeboxes located on
{bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x.
~

0 KILLER THIEF~
If you {PPK{x or {YPSteal{x from an injured player or a sleeping player, 
then you will receive a {PKILLER{x or {BTHIEF{x flag.  Once you have one 
of these flags, players outside of eight levels can attack you.  Once you 
have initiated combat against someone, the injured player/sleep restriction is 
lifted for that combat session. Thus, if your opponent flees, you can 
still track them down.

{PKILLER{x and {BTHIEF{x flags can be removed only at the discretion of 
the Immortals.  At no time are the Imms of Legacy required to ever remove 
a {PKILLER{x or {BTHIEF{x flag.
~

0 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING' FLAMING~
{PPlayer killing{x and {Yplayer stealing{x is restricted to only those who have their
{PPK flag{x set to the {Ron{x position.  Also, {PPK{x is restricted to within
eight levels. In addition, if you {PPK{x or {YPSteal{x from an injured player or a sleeping player, then you will receive a {PKILLER{x or {BTHIEF{x
flag.  Once you have one of these flags, players outside of eight levels
can attack you.  Once you have initiated combat against someone, the injured
player restriction is lifted for that combat session.  Thus, if your opponent
flees, you can still track them down.
See also the {RPK{x command.

For a friendly duel with no level restrictions and no serious losses, try
going to the {RLand of {PFlaming {YSword{x! Tickets there are sold just north of
Clan Road, all the way north from 'recall'. Once there, {WREAD SIGN{x
for details!
~

0 PK PKFLAG~
The {RPK ON{x command raises your PK flag. This is the prerequisites for 
engaging in player killing, both killing and being killed. {VOnce you 
raise your PK flag, you cannot lower it until you die to PK!{x Don't even 
bother trying, there is no PK OFF command :)
You can check you PK status by typing {RPK{x (without the {RON{x), which
will tell you if your flag is up or down. Your remort, level, class and race
will be outlined in {Pred brackets{x on the wholist if your pk is on.  You

the rating numbers stand for:

    {Bwait time{x/{Bhow damaged your gun is{x/{Phow good the gun is{x

The {Bfirst two{x you want to be as {Blow{x as possible.  The {Pthird one{x you want

These coaches depart from (currently) three well-marked locations in town:
{YInside the West Gate of Midgaard{x, {YInside the East Gate of Midgaard{x,
and {YCommon Square{x. The coaches travel to most of Legacy's areas, though
not always by the shortest route, and are available to anyone willing to
pay the fare. The fare depends on the distance to the final destination and
the level of the target area. The way to get on board a coach is to type
{RBOARD{x. Coaches stand around waiting for a while at the coach stops but
may be boarded en route by anyone quick enough to board a coach in travel.
A coach will seat a maximum of 4 players.

Players riding the coach are safe from any attacks as long as they stay
in the coach, but they will be on their own at the final destination,
where in some cases aggressive mobs may attack. Passengers may leave the
coach tour at any time by typing '{RALIGHT{x', which is formal English for
'come down'. When they do, they will be reimbursed for the portion of the
tour they have not yet taken. Thus, if you find yourself in a far too
expensive coach to an area you don't have a prayer in, remember to type
{RALIGHT{x and your price will be a light one.

The coaches travel at a comfortable speed for sight-seeing and
note-taking, both of which activities are encouraged. As the schedules
are random and the pace is slow, the coaches are not recommended for
getting anywhere in a hurry. {YEnjoy your tour!{x

0 AREAS~
Syntax: {Careas{x
        {Careas{x <{Ylevel{x>
        {Careas{x <{Ysearch-string{x>

This command shows you the areas of {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x.  Areas are shown with level
range, area name and author. Areas are sorted alphabetically by area
name.  For some areas, the range is replaced by {YALL, CLANS, HERO or IMM{x,
meaning this area is open to every one, members of their clans only,
heroes or immortals, respectively.

{CAreas{x by itself shows far too many areas to be readable.  As of this
writing, there are almost 100 areas in {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x and the number is growing.
So, if you are looking for an area appropriate for your level, type
{Careas 5{x (for example).  If you remember part of the name of an area or
its author, type something like {Careas the{x or {Careas elrac{x or {Careas clan{x.
~

0 BACKUP~
Syntax: {Cbackup{x

This command saves a backup copy of your character in a separate directory.
Unlike {Csave{x, this is *not* automatic but needs {Yyou{x to do it.
Having a backup copy of your character is good if your player file becomes
damaged somehow, the Imms can then restore your character from the backup.
We recommend doing {Rbackup{x about once a day.

Everytime you log in, the mud will notify you if it has been an hour or
longer since your last backup.	After 24 hours, the message will change
colors to catch your attention.

{YSEE ALSO:{x Save
~

0 CRUSH~
Syntax: {Ccrush{x

In a fight, this skill lets you do heavy physical damage to your opponent.
It is envisioned as an extra-strong bearhug, resulting in crushed ribs
and the like. (Think grapple)

At the moment, this skill is not available for gaining, and is only usable
by mobs. :(
~

0 KILL~
Syntax: {Ckill{x <{Ytarget{x>

This is the classical way to start a fight with another character, be it
a mob or a player. Note that attacking other players is subject to
numerous restrictions; see {Whelp pkill{x for details.

*One* {Ckill{x command is sufficient until one of the fighting parties
flees or dies. There is no need to repeat the command for the rest of
the fight.

Hint: Before deciding to {Ckill{x something, you should {Cconsider{x it
to see if you stand a chance.

{YSEE ALSO:{x help consider
~

0 NEXT~
Syntax: {Cnext{x
        {Cnext{x {Gunread{x

The {Cnext{x command is a convenient way to read all your unread notes, ideas,
roleplay notes, changes, personals, trade notes, and news. Every time you
type {Cnext{x, the next item (in chronological order) will be shown.  This
command freely mixes the different types of messages, moving forward from
the earliest unread (by you) message to the latest.

If you specify another word with {Cnext{x (we recommend {Cnext unread{x), then
your unread messages will be shown to you grouped by message type, so that
each board is finish before moving on to the next one.  The notes board is
first and trade note board is last.
~

0 SHOWFLAGS~
Syntax: {Cshowflags{x

{CShowflags{x shows you which game flags are set for your character.
Alas, the format is a bit hard to read and nobody is likely to explain
the names and values of the flags for you. Consider this an interesting
curiosity or an arcane command for the advanced player.
~

0 WORTH~
Syntax: {Cworth{x

{CWorth{x tells you how much gold, silver and experience you have on you,
as well as how many quest points and skill points you have accumulated.
If you only want to know this, it's much more convenient than {Cscore{x.
Note that this command does {Ynot{x tell you how much money you have
in the bank!

{YSEE ALSO:{x bank
~

0 COMBINE~
Syntax: {Ccombine{x

If you are looking at a lot of items and many of those items are of the
same type, you will probably prefer to have the repeated items shown
on only one line, with the number of items given. If you are carrying
3 long thin daggers, for example, you could see either:

long thin dagger
long thin dagger
long thin dagger

or (3) long thin dagger .

Type {Ccombine{x once to switch from the full listing to the summary,
and {Ccombine{x again to switch back to full if you want.

The effects of {Ccombine{x apply to the output you see from
{Cinventory{x, {Clook{x, {Cexamine{x and a few others.
~

0 DEFENSIVE~
Syntax: {Cdefensive{x

In a fight, it may be useful for you to see if your opponent is dodging
or parrying your attacks. On the other hand, you may have so much going
on that this extra information would just irritate you.

{Cdefensive{x lets you choose whether or not you see defensive blocks
(e.g. dodge, parry) in a fight or not. Type {Cdefensive{x once to stop
seeing these moves, and again if you would rather see them after all.
~

0 NOFOLLOW~
Syntax: {Cnofollow{x

This command sets your {Ynofollow{x flag, which prevents other characters
from following you. If you are being followed at the time you issue this
command, your followers will stop following you.

Typing {Cnofollow{x when your {Ynofollow{x flag is set turns it back off,
and lets people follow you again. If you broke the link to a follower
using {Cnofollow{x, that person will have to {Cfollow{x you again if they
want to.

You can check your current {Ynofollow{x status either by typing
{Rnofollow{x once or twice, or by looking in the output from {Rautolist{x.
~

0 NOSUMMON~
Syntax: {Cnosummon{x

This command sets or unsets your {Cnosummon{x flag, which keeps you safe
from being summoned as long as it is set. Many player-killing attacks are
started by summoning the victim, and this measure can thwart such
attempts. However, if you ever ask a friend to summon you, do remember
to unset the flag or they will waste a lot of mana trying.

You can check your current {Cnosummon{x status either by typing
{Cnosummon{x once or twice, or by looking in the output from {Cautolist{x.
~

0 NOLOOT~
Syntax: {Cnoloot{x

This command sets or unsets a flag which determines if others can loot
your corpse after you die. The normal setting is on, which means your
corpse will be safe from looters. Typing {Cnoloot{x will change that.  This
may come in handy if you die in a dangerous area and ask others to
retrieve the stuff from your corpse for you.

You can check your current {Ynoloot{x status either by typing {Cnoloot{x once or
twice, or by looking in the output from {Cautolist{x.
~

0 ENTER~
Syntax: {Renter{x {Yportal-name{x

There are many {Yportals{x in the game, mysterious gateways that allow you
to move by magical means from one room to another although those rooms
are not physically connected. To use a portal, you must {Renter{x it.
~

0 BATTLE ARENA~
The arena is built for PK tournaments among mortals.  Special rules and
commands are as follows:

1)  When you are in the arena, you will suffer no loss of exp or alignment.
2)  You will suffer no loss of equipment through death or stealing.
3)  When you die in the arena, you are teleported back to the temple
    healer with all your equipment still on your body.
4)  Breath spells donot provide the same affect in the arena as they 
    do outside it.
5)  The only way to exit the arena is through death or victory.
6)  There is a fee for entering the arena which is announced upon the
    declaration of battle.
7)  To enter the arena after a battle is announced, {Ytype: battle{x.
8)  There are no level/clan/ooc restrictions on PK within the arena.
9)  Anything that is not listed as a special rule above is no longer valid.
10) The victors within arena battle will accumulate their Arena Wins counter.

There is a walk-in arena available to anyone above a minimum level, for
a reasonable fee, called the Land of Flaming Sword.  Enter the door 3 north
of recall and {Vread the sign{x there!
~

0 FORGE SMITHY~
Syntax: {Rforge{x <{Yweapon type{x> <{Yweapon name{x>
 -or-   {Rforge flag{x <{Yflag type{x>

These two forms of the command cause two very different things to happen.

The FIRST creates a weapon from a bar of forging material which you hold
in your hand. The {Yweapon type{x can be any one of the following:
{Csword{x, {Cmace{x, {Cdagger{x, {Caxe{x, {Cpolearm{x, {Cstaff{x, {Cflail{x, or {Cwhip{x.

The {Yweapon name{x can be any string as long as it is less than 30
printed characters.  Color codes are not counted as a printed character.

A forged weapon's power is based on its creator's level, skill in making
weapons, and the type of material that is used.  To forge a weapon, the
crafter must be holding the material he or she wants to make the weapon
out of (the material must be of identify type: material).  Materials can
make your weapon easier to forge, or more difficult.  Other materials can
make your weapon stronger or weaker.  In addition, forged weapons will
take on the magical properties of the material that is used in making them.

The SECOND form of forging adds one of four magical attributes to a weapon
you are wielding. The weapon attribute can be any one of the following:
{Cflame{x, {Cfrost{x, {Cshock{x, and {Cblood{x. Your weapon must be at least
level 30 in order for you to be able to forge flags onto it.
These attributes are put on the weapon as *permanent* weapon flags with the
same effects as those which can *temporarily* be put on weapons using the
Bladecraft spells (see {RHELP BLADECRAFT{x for details). Your chance of
succeeding at this task depends on your skill at forging. If you fail, your
weapon will be destroyed!

This second type of forging is now also able to let you make a weapon
stronger and more powerful.  The downside, however, is that the added
weight necessary makes it two-handed.  To achieve this, use the flag type
{Ctwohanded{x.

BOTH forms of forging require that the forger be in the same room with a
special forging {Yanvil{x. See {RHELP ANVIL{x for details!
~

0 ANVIL~
An {YAnvil{x is required in order to forge weapons from raw materials
or to forge enhancing attributes (weapon flags) onto a weapon.

A public forging anvil is available in the smithy below Griswald's
Repair Shop on Clan Road in Midgaard. This anvil, like most of its kind,
has costs associated with its use. {YWeapon forging{x costs a number of
gold coins wheras {Yflag forging{x costs the forger quest points.
~

0 SHOWLOST~
Syntax: {Cshowlost{x

By enabling the showlost feature, you will be notified of any items in
your locker or inventory that will be lost before quiting.
~

0 SHOWFLAG~
Syntax: {Cshowflag{x
        {Cshowflag{x <{Yvictim{x> ({YImmortal Only{x)

This command will display your current flag status.  If you are an
immortal, it can also display flag status for mobiles and other players.
~

0 STRENGTH STR~
{CStrength{x as the name suggests is a mark on how strong you are. The
stronger you are the more damage you do, the more you can carry (weight
wise) and you are able to wield heavier weaponry. 
~ 

0 DEXTERITY DEX~
{CDexterity{x is a measure of your agility and prowess. The higher
it is the easier it is to avoid attacks.
~

0 INTELLIGENCE INT~
{CIntelligence{x is a mark of how clever you are. Intelligence is used for 
gaining more mana per level, specifically by magic-using classes. It also
guides how much of a percentage increase you get when you practice.
~

0 WISDOM WIS~
{CWisdom{x is used to define how wise you are, and marks how many practices
you get per level.
~    

0 CONSTITUTION CON~
{CConstitution{x is the mark of how healthy you are, the higher your
constitution the more hit point you'll gain per level.
~

0 CHARISMA CHR~
{CCharisma{x affects how you interact with monsters and the Hidden Fates.
Specifically, a high charisma makes aggressive monsters less likely to
attack you (they may hesitate just long enough for you to wander on by,
or long enough for you to have a nice nap). Also, with a high charisma,
you have a chance of getting 2 {Ytrains{x {G(!){x each time you gain a level.
~

0 VIDEO  DARK  VT100  FLASH~
Syntax: {Cvideo flash <{Yon, off, or underline{x>
        {Cvideo dark  <{Ynormal or modify{x>
        {Cvideo vt100 <{Yon or off{x>
        {Cvideo codes <{Yshow or hide{x>

{Cvideo flash{x controls how text designed to flash ({{f) will appear on your
screen (flashing, normal, or underlined). Underlined text may appear as
reversed video, depending on your screen emulator. {Cvideo dark{x controls
how you will see black ({{k) and charcoal ({{c) text (normal means you
see them as black or charcoal, modify means black and charcoal will appear
as grey). {Cvideo vt100{x {Yon{x sends output to your terminal in vt100 mode
(which may well not be what you want, so {Cvideo vt100{x {Yoff{x will fix it).
{Cvideo codes{x {Yshow{x will show you the code sequences used in colored strings
that you see.  This will probably give you a headache, so you can use
{Cvideo codes{x {Yoff{x to turn it off again.
~

0 CLEAR~
Syntax: {Cclear{x

Clears the screen.
~

0 MULTIPLAY  MULTIPLAYING  MULTIPLAYERS  MULTI~
The act of simultaneously playing more than one character at the same time
is call Multiplaying. This is an illegal act here on Legacy.  Playing more
than one character makes it easier for you to level, true, but it takes
away from the roleplaying experience and fun you can have when you just
try and flesh out one character.  It also gives you an unfair advantage
over those who try to follow the rules.  Having two characters on at the
same time, even if they aren't interacting with each other.  Even if one
is playing while the other is recovering (sleeping) is still multiplaying.
The point is, no logging on with multiple Characters.
~

0 GOLD  SILVER  MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25/pound, as opposed to
100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweler, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.  Also see '{YHELP BANK{x'
~

0 LOCKER~
Syntax: {Clook in locker{x
        {Cget{x <{Yobject{x> {Vlocker{x
        {Cget all locker{x
        {Cput{x <{Yobject{x> {Vlocker{x
        {Cput all locker{x

{CLockers{x work in a similar manner to containers, however, your {Clocker{x
is safely located in the town of Midgaard while you are off adventuring
throughout Thera.  Your {Clocker{x costs {Y10 silver{x for every object kept
inside.  The fee is deducted every time you quit the game.  If you cannot
afford to pay the fee, then your {Clocker{x will be closed and you will not
be able to get items from your {Clocker{x until the fee can be paid.  The "late
fee" will be deducted the next time you try to get something from your
{Clocker{x and your funds are sufficient.  Your {Clocker{x also has a maximum
limit for the number and size of items that can be contained within it.
~

0 BANK  DEPOSIT  WITHDRAW  BALANCE~
Due to the heavy weight of gold the city bank has been reopened! You can
safely store your gold and silver in the bank by using the following commands:

{Cdeposit{x <{Yamount{x> gold or {Cdeposit{x <{Yamount{x> silver will {Cdeposit{x
that amount of gold/silver into your account.

{Pwithdraw{x <{Yamount{x> gold or {Pwithdraw{x <{Yamount{x> silver will {Pwithdraw{x
that amount of gold/silver from your account.

{Gbalance{x: Shows how much gold and silver you currently have in the bank.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
{GBrief{x and {YCompact{x help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed) and player's descriptions
when you look at them.

Typing {Ycompact{x removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

0 AFK  REPLAY~
Syntax: {Cafk{x <{Ymessage{x>
        {Creplay{x

Typing {Cafk{x puts your character in a tell-saving mode so that any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
{Greplay{x.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10
minutes, but don't want to miss tells.  {CAFK{x shows up in your prompt
until it is turned off.

Tells to linkdead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also
be seen by typing {Greplay{x (unless, of course, the character logs off
before reading them).

After {Y7{x ticks of inactivity, you will be set Auto-AFK by the mud.  After
{Y14{x ticks, you are transfered to the void.  After {Y30{x ticks, you are forced
to quit.
~

0 PUSH  DRAG~
Syntax: {Cpush{x <{Yvictim{x>
        {Cdrag{x <{Yvictim{x>

If you want to {Cpush{x a standing victim or {Cdrag{x a sitting/resting victim,
{Cpush{x and {Cdrag{x is a skill all players have.  It is based on the relative
strength of both individuals involved with a little random variation.
{CPush{x and {Cdrag{x fall under the same restrictions as PK combat (must be
within 8 levels, can't {Cpush{x/{Cdrag{x in a safe room, etc).  If you attempt
to {Cpush{x/{Cdrag{x a mobile and fail, the mobile will attack you.
~

0 LEVELS~
Syntax: {Clevels{x <{Yclassname{x>

This command will provide information on spell levels for a specific class.
It will then follow the spell levels with a listing of skill levels.
~

0 PROMPTTYPES~
In all cases the short version of a selected prompt does not show
the max values for things like hp or mana since people would tend
to know what the max value is by heart and be more concerned with
what the current value is so they can keep it above zero.

Default  - {W<{C30{Thp {G30{Hma {B30{Nmv {W[{gNeSw{W] {R728{W>{x
           The {Vdefault{x prompt shows hit points, mana, movement, exits,
           and experience until next level.

Short    - {W<{C30{Thp {G30{Hma {B30{Nmv{W>{x
           The {Vshort{x prompt shows hit points, mana, and movement.

Long     - {W<{C30{g/{C30{Thp {G30{g/{G30{Hma {B30{Nmv {W[{cNeSw{W] {Y24{C/{g34 {W( {gMidgaard {W) {R734{W>{x
           The {Vlong{x prompt shows hit points, mana, movement, exits, gold,
           silver, area name, and experience until next level.

Quest    - {W<{C30{g/{C30{Thp {G30{g/{G30{Hma {B30{Nmv {Y({bNone 0{Y){W>{x
           The {Vquest{x prompt shows hit points, mana, movement and the
           quest target and quest time.

Riches   - {W<{C30{g/{C30{Thp {G30{g/{G30{Hma {B30{Tmv {W[{gNeSw{W] {Y24{bg {W34{gs{W>{x
           The {Vriches{x prompt shows the hit points, mana, movement, gold,
           and silver.

Align    - {W<{C30{g/{C30{Thp {G30{g/{G30{Hma {B30{Nmv {W[{cNeSw{W] {R728 {V({M-1000{V){W>{x
           The {Valign{x prompt shows hit points, mana, movement, exits,
           experience until next level, and alignment.

Immortal - {W<{Y({W1223{Y) {T-{CImm Room{T- {H[{GNeSw{H] {WIMM-Zone {N[{B0/92{N]{W>{x
           The {Vimmortal{x prompt shows room vnum, name, exits, area, wizi,
           and incog status.  This prompt will not display properly if you are
           not immortal.

{VPrefix{x allows you to start every command with the {Vprefix{x message.
To turn {VPrefix{x off, just type {VPrefix{x without an argument.

{CPrompt{x without an argument will turn your prompt on or off.
{CPrompt default{x will give you the standard "<hits mana moves>" prompt.

~

0 DEATH MORGUE~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the
Temple of Mota.  You corpse is relocated by an act of the dark god to the
Altar of Necromancy together with all of your equipment.  If you are above
level 50, your corpse will not be relocated and will be found in the room
you perished.

Any spells which were affecting you are canceled by death.

You lose experience points for dying.  The amount you lose is two-thirds of
the way back to the beginning of your level.

A corpse will decay after time, and the objects inside the corpse will
decay with them. A player's corpse will last *roughly* 30 hours of game
time (15 minutes of real time). Only the player who died, or if you were
grouped, someone in the same group, can retrieve objects from a player's
corpse.  Objects on a player corpse will not be lost when it decays.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You {Cgain{x experience when you kill a monster and when you are part of a
group that kills a monster.

You {Plose{x experience when you flee from combat, recalled out of combat,
being the target of certain spells, and dying.

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many
players are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster;
your alignment versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster
have been killed lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, and
after the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.  When you buy your
pet, you are given a chance to name it; the syntax is:
     {Ybuy {c<petspecies> {R<name>{x.
Thereafter, you can refer to your pet by its name in {Yorders{x, {Ylook{x, and
other commands.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell 
duration, weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called
the 'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 45 seconds of real time, but the
actual amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area;
less often (15 minutes) if someone is.  Also note that objects lying on
the ground won't be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: {Cexits{x

Tells you the {Yvisible{x {Cexits{x of the room you are in, but not all {Cexits{x
are visible. You can use {CSCAN{x to find those that are not, however :)
~

0 DROP  GET  GIVE  PUT  TAKE~
Syntax: {Cdrop{x <{Yobject{x>
        {Cdrop{x <{Ynumber{x>*{x<{Yobject{x>
        {Cdrop{x <{Yamount{x> {Ccoins{x
        {Mget{x  <{Yobject{x>

        {Ggive{x <{Yobject{x> <{Ycharacter{x>
        {Ggive{x <{Ynumber{x>*{x<{Yobject{x> <{Ycharacter{x>
        {Ggive{x <{Yamount{x> {Gcoins{x <{Ycharacter{x>
        {Vput{x  <{Yobject{x> <{Ycontainer{x>

{CDrop{x drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

{MGet{x gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or
even from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

{MGive{x gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

{VPut{x puts an object into a container.

{CDrop{x, {Mget{x and {Vput{x understand the object names '{Yall{x' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

You can use {CDrop{x or {Ggive{x to drop or give {Ymultiple objects of the same type{x
if you put a number and an asterisk ({C*{x) in front of the object's name.
Examples:  {Pdrop 5*handkerchief{x or {Pgive 10*bread beggar{x.
~

0 EQUIPMENT  INVENTORY~
Syntax: {Cequipment{x
        {Cinventory{x

{CEQUIPMENT{x lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items).
{CINVENTORY{x lists your inventory.

{YSEE ALSO:{x combine
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: {Ccompare{x <{Yobject-1{x> <{Yobject-2{x>
        {Ccompare{x <{Yobject{x>

{CCompare{x compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are
weapons, it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both
objects are armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

{CCompare{x with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the
object you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

{CCompare{x doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: {Cflee{x

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to {Cflee{x, or another character can
{Crescue{x you.  (You can also {CRECALL{x, but this is less likely to work,
and will cost more experience points than fleeing.) The act of fleeing
is based on your dexterity, the number of mobs you are currently fighting,
level difference and random chance.  Flee does not automatically succeed
though, as it is sometimes impossible to back away from a fight.

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to {CRECALL{x from time-to-time.  Your chances
of making the {CRECALL{x are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
You can toggle this feature with the {Cautoflee{x command.
~

0 EXAMINE  LOOK  READ~
Syntax: {Clook{x
        {Clook{x    <{Yobject{x>
        {Clook{x    <{Ycharacter{x>
        {Clook{x    <{Ydirection{x>

        {Vexamine{x <{Ycontainer{x>
        {Vexamine{x <{Ycorpse{x>

{CLook{x looks at something and sees what you can see.

{CRead{x does exactly the same as {CLook{x. People like to use it with books,
maps and signs.

{VExamine{x is short for '{Clook{x {Ycontainer{x' followed by '{Clook in{x {Ycontainer{x'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: {Corder{x <{Ycharacter{x> <{Ycommand{x>
        {Corder all{x <{Ycommand{x>
        {Corder{x <{Ypet{x> {Ystay{x
        {Corder{x <{Ypet{x> {Yfollow{x

{COrder{x orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed).

By ordering your pet to stay or follow, you can control your pet's location.
~

0  SLEEP  WAKE  REST  SIT  STAND  WAKE~
Syntax: {Prest{x      or {Prest{x  <{Yfurniture{x>
        {Psleep{x     or {Psleep{x <{Yfurniture{x>
        {Psit{x	      or {Psit{x   <{Yfurniture{x>
        {Ystand{x
        {Ywake{x      or {Ywake{x {Ccharacter{x

These commands change your position.  When you {Prest{x or {Psleep{x, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you {Psleep{x,
you won't hear many things happen.

You may choose to {Ysit{x when talking with a friend.

If there is furniture available that supports sleeping, resting or
sitting on, then you can specify the name of that item with your
{Prest{x, {Psleep{x or {Psit{x command. You may sleep better in a bed
than on the floor :)

Use {Ystand{x or {Ywake{x to come back to a standing position.  You can also
{Ywake{x to wake up other sleeping characters.
~

0 GTELL~
Syntax:  {Cgtell{x <{Ymessage{x>

{CGtell{x sends a message to all of the characters in your group, wherever
they are, even if they are sleeping or stunned or dying.  '{C;{x' is an
acceptable synonym for {Cgtell{x.
~

0 TELL REPLY DEAF~
Syntax: {Ctell{x  <{Ymessage{x>
        {Creply{x <{Ymessage{x>
        {Creply lock{x
        {Cdeaf{x

{CTell{x sends a message to one player anywhere in the world, providing you
can see them.  {CReply{x sends a message to the last player who sent you a
{Ctell{x.  {CReply{x will work even if you can't see the player, and without
revealing their identity.  This is handy for talking to unseen or switched
immortal players.  You can type {Creply lock{x after receiving a tell to keep
all your replies set to a certain player.  If you don't want to receive
tells from other players, type '{Cdeaf{x'.  You can type {Cdeaf{x again to turn
tells back on.
~

0 SAY~
Syntax: {Csay{x <{Ymessage{x>

{CSay{x sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote
'{C'{x' is a synonym for {Vsay{x.
~

0 IGNORE~
Syntax: {CIgnore
        {CIgnore {x<{Yplayer{x>

The {Cignore{x command can be used to ignore all comments made by a certain
player over most of the channels.  The only channels that are not covered
by ignore are say, emote, and pmote.  Ignore by itself will show you a
list of players who are currently being ignored.
~

0 QUERY QTELL~
Syntax: {CQuery list{x           : Lists names in your query.
        {CQuery +{x <{Yname{x>   : Adds a name to your query.
        {CQuery -{x <{Yname{x>   : Removes a name from query.
        {CQuery clear{x          : Clears your query.
        {CQtell {x<{Ymessage{x>  : Sends a message to your query list.

The {CQuery{x channel is similar to the {Cgtell{x channel.  However, you do
not have to be following another player or be grouped with them to use the
channel.  Whoever is in your {Cquery{x will receive your message when you
use {Cqtell{x, but it is important to remember that if you are replying to
someone with the {Cqtell{x channel, ensure that they are in your {Cquery list{x.
~

0 STORAGE VACATION~
If you are leaving for an extended period of time, you may request that
your character be put in storage, to avoid the necessary cleanup of
inactive characters.  If you wish to do this, post a note to immortal
or send an email to legacy@kyndig.com.
~

0 NOTIFY~
Syntax: {Cnotify{x

Toggles the broadcast messages for new notes.

When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
{Rnote read{x or {Rnext{x to scroll through them one at a time.

Six other note directories exist, these are IDEAS, NEWS, CHANGES, PERSONAL,
TRADE and ROLEPLAY.  They are used the exact same way, for example idea read
5 will read idea #5.  Posting to the news and changes boards is
restricted. The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on
all the note spools. See also {RHELP NEXT{x.

The personal message board is slightly special.  If a note's recipient is
strictly personal(playername, clanname, remort, or immortal), then it will
automatically post to the personal message board.  If a personal message
recipient includes "all" in it, then it will be automatically posted to the
note message board.

{YSEE ALSO:{x tolerance
~

0 TOLERANCE~
{P*****Tolerance*****{x

{YIf you wish to ramble, post your notes to {Vspam{Y.{x
Posting mindless, spammy notes to everyone on the mud is a waste of space,
time, and patience.  If you are unsure if your note fits into the useless spam
category, you probably don't want to post it.  If you really want to post it,
then check with the Immortals.  Note that we have other things on our list of
chores, and will be bothered by repeated queries.  Notes in poor taste will
be removed.

{PExcessive swearing on global note boards (ie. {YNOT{P personal) is strictly
prohibited.{x

If you swear in a personal note, be sure the person receiving the note 
will not be offended, as none of the note boards are censored.  The Immortals
will use their judgment as to how much swearing is tolerable.  If an Immortal
tells you to remove a note, remove it, and note the Imp if you have any
concerns.

in as the <{Yaction{x> will be seen by people in the room (or all over
the MUD if you use {Csocial emote{x) with your name in front of it.

Whatever action you want to show, chances are it's already available
as a pre-built {Csocial{x. Type {Whelp socials{x for information about
these 'canned' actions and {Wsocials{x to see the list.

{CPose{x produces a random message to your room depending on your class
and level. The message generally shows off your prowess at whatever
your class does.
~

0 MORESOCIALS~
Although {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x has {GMANY{x socials at present, people keep thinking up new
ones. There is room for some more, but the implementor must keep watching
the socials count in {VMEMORY{x and check it against {YMAX_SOCIALS{x in the code.
{PAn overabundance of socials caused the Great Crash of July 1997 :({x

Assuming that '{Ychar{x' is the one who performs the social,
'{Yvictim{x' is the one 'char' does it to (if anybody), and
'{Yroom{x' means third parties in the room observing the social,
a complete definition of a social consists of 8 strings:

{c/=============================================================================\
{c|{N(1){c| {Gsocial name                   {c| {Ylaugh                                   {c|

{c|{N(3){c| {Gmsg to room if done to nobody {c| {Y$n falls down laughing.                 {c|
{c|{N(4){c| {Gmsg to char if victim found   {c| {YYou laugh at $N mercilessly.            {c|
{c|{N(5){c| {Gmsg to room if victim found   {c| {Y$n laughs at $N mercilessly.            {c|
{c|{N(6){c| {Gmsg to victim                 {c| {Y$n laughs at you mercilessly. Hmmph.    {c|
{c|{N(7){c| {Gmsg to char if victim=char    {c| {YYou laugh at yourself. I would, too.    {c|
{c|{N(8){c| {Gmsg to room if victim=char    {c| {Y$n laughs at $mself. Let's all join in! {c|
{c\=============================================================================/

Social name must always be in lower case. Social text should be no longer
than 70 chars. Here are the definitions of the $ characters:

{c/{GItem      {c/{BFor Char    {c/{PFor Victim
{c===================================
{c={Gname       {B$n           {P$N       {c=

        {Gwield{x  <{Yobject{x>

The {Chold{x, {Pwear{x, and {Gwield{x commands take an item from your inventory and

and staves.  {PWear{x is for armor, and {Gwield{x is for weapons.  {PWear{x can
be used in lieu of {Chold{x and {Gwield{x for any item.

{YWear all{x will attempt to {Chold{x, {Pwear{x, or {Gwield{x each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to {Chold{x, {Pwear{x, or {Gwield{x an item if its alignment does
not match yours, if it's too heavy for you, or if you're not experienced
enough to use it properly.

If you are {Yvery{x hungry, you can eat {Ymultiple objects of the same type{x
by typing a number and an asterisk ({C*{x) before the name of the object.
Example: {Peat 5*bread{x.

{GFill{x fills a drink container with water.

{YPour{x transfers a liquid to a container, or empties one.  You can also
pour from an object into something a character is holding.

        {Vlist{x  <{Yname{x>
        {Psell{x  <{Yobject{x>
        {Gvalue{x <{Yobject{x>

{CBuy{x buys an object from a shopkeeper. When multiple items of the same
name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where 'n' is the position of the item
in a list of that name.  So if there are two swords, buy 2.sword will buy
the second. If you want to buy multiples of an item, use an * (buy 5*pie
will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into (for example) buy 2*2.shield,
as long as the * is first.

{VList{x lists the objects the shopkeeper will sell you.  {VList{x <{Yname{x> shows
you only objects of that name.

{YSell{x sells an object to a shopkeeper.

{GValue{x asks the shopkeeper how much he/she/it will buy the item for.

        {PJunk{x      <{Yobject{x>
        {VDonate{x    <{Yobject{x>

{CSacrifice{x offers an object to the gods, who may reward you.  The amount
of the reward depends upon the level of object.

{CTap{x does the same as sacrifice.

{PJunk{x removes an item from your inventory.  The gods do not offer rewards
for junked items.

{VDonate{x transports an item from your inventory to the public Donation Pit
in Midgaard.  ({YSEE ALSO:{x pit)
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: {Cscroll{x
        {Cscroll{x <{Ynumber{x>

This command changes the maximum number of lines that can be sent to your
screen at once.  If you look at something longer than your scroll number,
(a long description, note, or inventory, for instance) you will have to
[Hit enter to continue] for each page.  The default value is 24 lines.
~

0 BRANDISH STAFF WAND QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: {PBrandish{x
        {CQuaff{x  <{Ypotion{x>
        {VRecite{x <{Yscroll{x> <{Ytarget{x>
        {GZap{x    <{Ytarget{x>
        {GZap{x

{PBRANDISH{x brandishes a magical staff.  {CQUAFF{x quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  {VRECITE{x recites a magical scroll; the
<{Ytarget{x> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  {GZAP{x zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must {RHOLD{x a wand or a staff before using {PBRANDISH{x or {GZAP{x.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills {Wscrolls{x, {Wstaves{x, and {Wwands{x for more information.
~

80 SCON CONSIDER~
Syntax: {Cscon{x <{Yvictim{x>
	{Cscon{x <{Yvictim{x> {Gmore{x
        {Cconsider{x <{Yvictim{x>

The {Cscon{x command is a short consider that displays only hit points, mana,
and level of a mobile.  If you add the {Gmore{x flag then you will also see
affects, vulnerabilities, resistances, alignment, and immunities.

The more powerful {Cconsider{x available to high level players will show a
great deal of information, some useful, some not.  However, it is subject
to change without warning. :)
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: {Cconsider{x <{Ycharacter{x>

{CConsider{x tells you what your chances are of killing a monster.  Of course,
it's only a rough estimate, based on level.
~

0 FOLLOW  GROUP~
Syntax: {Cfollow{x <{Ycharacter{x>
        {Cgroup{x
        {Cgroup{x <{Ycharacter{x>

{CFollow{x starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just {Cfollow{x <{Yyourself{x>.

{CGroup{x <{Ycharacter{x> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the {Cgtell{x and
{Csplit{x commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight if they have {CautoassistPx on.

If the <{Ycharacter{x> is already a member of your group, then {Cgroup{x will
kick out the <{Ycharacter{x> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a {Cfollow{x command to stop following you.

{CGroup{x with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You only provides experience as long as no member of your group is more
than six levels above you.

{YSEE ALSO:{x nofollow

0 VISIBLE~
{CVisible{x cancels any hide, sneak, invisibility, lurk, or wizinvis affects
you might have.
~

0 QUIT	RENT  SAVE~
Syntax: {Cquit{x
        {Csave{x

{CSave{x saves your character and objects.  The game saves your character
every 15 minutes, and this is the preferred method of saving.  Typing {Csave{x
will block all other commands for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds generated too much lag.)

Some objects, such as certain keys, may not be saved.

{CQuit{x leaves the game.  You may {Cquit{x anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

{CQuit{x automatically does a {Ysave{x, so you can safely leave the game with just
one command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to {Ysave{x before {Cquit{x.  If you
get into the habit of using {Cquit{x without {Ysave{x, and then you play some other
mud that doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no {PRENT{x in this mud.  Just {Ysave{x and {Cquit{x whenever you want to leave.

~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: {Crecall{x

{CRecall{x prays to Mota for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '{C/{x' is a synonym for {Crecall{x.

If you {Crecall{x during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing).  This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100%
{Crecall{x does not ensure success. {CRecall{x costs 25% of your stamina.
{CRecall{x doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms, and characters
afflicted by a curse may not {Crecall{x at all.
~

0 SPLIT~
Syntax: {Csplit{x <{Ysilver{x> <{Ygold{x>

{CSplit{x will split the amount of coins between you and all the members of
your group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to {Csplit{x the
loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver (0 is
acceptable), and the second gold (optional).

Examples:
{Msplit{x 30        --> split 30 silver
{Msplit{x 20 50     --> split 20 silver, 50 gold
{Msplit{x  0 10     --> split 10 gold
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: {Cpractice{x
        {Cpractice abc{x <{Yskill{x/{Yspell or abbreviation{x>
        {Cpractice %{x
        {Cpractice groups{x
        {Cpractice groups{x <{Ygroup name or abbreviation{x>
        {Cpractice{x <{Yskill{x/{Yspell{x>

{CPractice{x without an argument or {Cpractice abc{x tells you your
current ability level in all the skills and spells available to you.
You can check this anywhere. The list is sorted in alphabetical order.

{CPractice abc{x and one or more letters will restrict the list to
spells and skills beginning with those letters.

{CPractice %{x will show your skills and spells sorted in decreasing
order of proficiency.

{CPractice groups{x will show your your skills and spells by skill/
spell groups. If you type a group name after the {Rgroups{x, the list
will be limited to that group or those groups matching what you typed.

{CPractice{x with an argument practices that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 1% (unlearned) to a maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guildmaster to practice, and
you can practice to a maximum of 75% with practice sessions; beyond that
you must learn in combat.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
use them.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: {Ctrain{x <{Ystr int wis dex con chr hp mana{x>

{CTRAIN{x increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana, hp, or movement by 10.  You receive one session per level.

The best attributes to train first are {PWIS{x and {PCON{x.  {PWIS{x gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  {PCON{x gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be more powerful if you train
{PWIS{x and {PCON{x both to 18 before practicing or training anything else.
~

0 TRUST~
Having trust enables your character to have access to commands at 
your trust level.  However, it does not change the permanant stats 
of your character.  Thus, having trust of 91 allows your character 
to have access to the hero channel and the scon command even though 
you are below the required level.
~

0 AUCTION~
Syntax: {Cauction{x
        {Cauction{x <{Yitem{x>

        {Cauction status{x
        {Cauction bid{x <{Yamount{x> (in gold)
        {Cauction stop{x               ({PImmortal Only{x)

{CAuction{x without an argument will toggle the auction channel off and on.
{CAuction{x with an argument will select an item for auction.
{CAuction status{x will display some information about the object
        including the current bids.
{VAuction bid{x will place your bid.  You must bid at least 1 gold if the
        auction has just started, or 10% more than the previous bidder.
        Note that all amounts are numbers of {Ygold{x coins, and you must
        be carrying the actual number of gold coins you wish to bid; the
        auction mechanism will not exchange coinage for you.
{VAuction{x with a minimum bid prevents your item for being sold too
        cheaply.  The minimum bid cannot be greater than 10,000.
{VAuction stop{x can be used by {PImmortals{x to confiscate auctioned items.
~

0 GLOBAL SOCIAL~

        {Csocial emote{x <{Ymessage{x>    (see {WHELP EMOTE{x)

The {Csocial{x channel is used for displaying your actions across the MUD.
Typing {Vsocial{x by itself will toggle the channel on and off.
{Csocial{x <{Ymessage{x> shows everyone in the MUD:
     {G[S] {Yyour-name{x {Gsocializes {x'<{Ymessage{x>{G'{x
{Vsocial{x <{Ysocial{x> shows the given social to everyone in the MUD.
     {Vsoc hop{x yields:
     {G[S] {Yyour-name{x {Ghops around like a little kid.{x

Flame is a channel intended for complaints, frustrations, and otherwise 
inappropriate language that you are free to air here.  Foul language and
swearing otherwise not allowed should be used here, where people have the
option to turn the channel off if they do not feel like listening.  

Typing {Cflame{x without any arguments will toggle the channel on and off.
{Cflame who{x will tell you who is tuned in to this channel at the moment.

0 QWEST @~
Syntax: {Cqwest{x <{Ymessage{x>
        {Cqwest{x {Gwho{x
        {Cqwest{x

This command lets you communicate quest-related information to others
in the game.  It's spelled funny so as not to conflict with the {Cquest{x
command, which is already used for something else. This channel is
typically used to communicate questions and answers for trivia quests,
or to issue instructions for major quests.

'@' is a valid short form for the {Cqwest{x command.

Typing {Cqwest{x without any arguments toggles the channel on and off.
{Cqwest who{x will tell you who is tuned in to this channel at the moment.
~

0 PRAY~
Syntax: {Cpray{x <{Ymessage{x>
	{Cpray{x {Gwho{x
	{Cpray{x

This command is for communication between mortals and immortals. When you
{Cpray{x, chances are that some immortal will hear you and answer your.  Note
that the immortals are pretty busy folk and often don't have time to chat
about trivial things with everyone in the game.  Try not to take up TOO
much of their time.

Typing {Cpray{x without any arguments toggles this channel on and off.
{Cpray who{x will tell you who is tuned in to this channel at the moment.

population of Thera.

Typing {Cmusic{x without any arguments toggles the channel on and off.
{Cmusic who{x will tell you who is tuned in to this channel at the moment.

0 QUESTION ANSWER Q/A~
Syntax: {Cquestion/answer{x
        {Cquestion/answer{x <{Ymessage{x>
        {Cquestion/answer{x {Gwho{x

The Question/Answer channel, called Q/A, actually has two commands to
operate it: {Cquestion{x and {Canswer{x.  They do the same thing, so you can ask
a question with {Canswer{x and answer one with {Cquestion{x.  Your questions and
answers will be heard all over the MUD.  This  channel is typically used
by players who have a tricky problem and are looking for other players
with a good answer to the problem.

Typing {Cquestion{x or {Canswer{x without any arguments toggles the channel on
and off.  {Cquestion who{x or {Canswer who{x will tell you who else is tuned in
to this channel at the moment.
~

0 GRATS~
Syntax: {Cgrats{x <{Ymessage{x>
	{Cgrats{x {Gwho{x
	{Cgrats{x

{W-{Cgrats{W-{x is a channel dedicated to congratulating other players, usually
for levelling. Yes, 'grats' is short for 'congratulations'.

Typing {Cgrats{x without any arguments toggles the channel on and off.
{Cgrats who{x will tell you who is tuned in to this channel at the moment.
~

0 HERO~

{WHero{x is the only mortal level with a name. It is the name of level 91,
the last non-immortal level. It takes a lot of work to get here, so
heroes are usually held in high regard in the game. Heroes gain a number
of convenient privileges when they reach this level. For one, they can
die without losing experience.

On the other hand, heroes do not gain experience. When they are done
showing off their newly-found power, their best bet is to ask an Imm
for a {CREMORT{x and start over as a rather powerful newbie.

{YSEE ALSO:{x remort
~

0 PMOTE~
Syntax: {Cpmote{x {Gmessage{x

{Cpmote{x works a lot like {Cemote{x, but if you do it correctly, any
full-name references to other people in the room (properly spelled and
capitalized) will be translated to 'you' and 'your' for the person
so named.

Example: Elrac types: {Ypmote slaps Vicky.{x
         Vicky sees:  {CElrac slaps you.{x
         Ronja sees:  {CElrac slaps Vicky.{x

In other words, {Cpmote{x is a way to do {Cemote{xs with a better chance
of naming people correctly so that nobody in the room (including the
target) can tell the difference between a real action and an emoted one.
~

0 PAGE~
Syntax: {Cpage{x <{Yplayer{x> {Gmessage{x
        {Cpage{x

{W*{Cpage{W*{x is a message channel you can use if you're desparate to get the
attention of another player. It sends a message to a particular player,
just like {Ctell{x does, but is accompanied by a bell sound if the person's
terminal supports sound. You can see it being a bit loud and bothersome
to some people, so please don't overuse it.

{Cpage{x is a good way to get people back to their terminals if they are AFK
(away from keyboard), as it goes through the AFK state, unlike {Ctell{x.

Typing {Cpage{x by itself toggles your pager on and off.

0 SAVES ARMORCLASS THAC0 HITROLL DAMROLL~

{GSome explanations of frequently misunderstood stats:{x

    {YSAVES{x
The {YSaves{x value represents your ability to resist spells; the lower the
better, with {Cnegative{x values being very good.

    {YARMOR CLASS{x
The {YAC{x ({YArmor Class{x) values represent how hard it is to hit you.  A lower
value means you are harder to hit.  There are four categories : pierce,
bash, slash, and magic.  Again, {Cnegative{x values are even better than low
positive values.

    {YTHAC0{x
The {YThac0{x ({YTo-Hit-AC-Zero{x) represents your base ability to hit enemies.
This value only depends on your level and class.  A lower value means you
hit more easily. {CNegative{x values are great.

    {YHIT ROLL{x / {YDAM ROLL{x
{YHit Roll{x and {YDam Roll{x represent your ability to hit enemies and to hurt
them.  They depend on the objects you are wearing, on your weapon, and on
your strength and dexterity.  The {Rhigher{x this value, the better a
fighter you are.
~

0 COPYOVER~
{CCOPYOVER{x is an imm command which is used to re-load the game for
changes in areas or program software. {YMortals{x should know this:

A copyover is not always successful, it may crash the game. You should
{CSAVE{x when a copyover is announced.

If the copyover crashes the game, try to reconnect again soon. The game
should be back up within less than a minute.

A copyover always results in a complete game reset. If you were fighting a
mob at the time of copyover, when it's over you may be facing a brand new
and healthy copy of the mob, whereas you will have the same wounds you had
before the copyover.  If you are in an aggressive mob's room at copyover
time, that mob will be there after the copyover and will attack you.  All
quests will be forfeited. The donation pit will also be emptied, all shop-
keepers will revert to their normal inventory, and you will lose anything in
your inventory which is more than seven levels above you. Thus,

- When {CCOPYOVER{x is announced, {Yfinish any current fight as soon as
  possible, and move to some place where you will be safe from aggressive
  mobs!{x  {PDo not start any new quests or fights!{x

- If you are in the middle of a quest or a fight and need some time to
  finish up, use {WGOSSIP{x to inform the immortal and (s)he will usually
  give you a chance to get ready.

- Buy anything in the shop that you might have been saving for, and get
  what you need from the pit. And get someone of higher level to hold that
  precious item you just bought at auction but can't use for a few levels.

When you see a message saying
   {W*** COPYOVER by (immortal) ... please remain seated!{x
then you can start playing as soon as you can move again.

Syntax: {Rc{Pensor{x

{RC{Pensor{x shows the types of words currently being filtered.

{bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x is a mud oriented and open to all ages, and because of this, 
there are {Rc{Pensor rules{x.  

{T*{x All characters start out on {GPG{x mode, which censors swear words and 
  has the {P*FlAmE*{x channel off.  If you set yourself to {PR{x mode, do not 
  complain about language or swearing.

{T*{x {YGossip{x, {Hsocial{x, and {Vpray{x are {Cno-swear channels{x.  Notes are also {Cno-
  swear zones{x.  Because these are the primary channels / methods of 
  communication, a certain modicum of courtesy and respect should be
  maintained.

{T*{x On all other channels, be wary of what you say.  Swear words used
  to insult another player, or swear words disguised that slip past
  the censor shall be punished immediately and harshly.

{T*{x {PFlame{x is a {Bfree-for-all channel{x.  Period.  If you do not like what
  is being said on {Pflame{x, you may turn it off.  However, please note
  the last rule ...

{T* Racial, gender, or sexual slurs will NOT be tolerated on Legacy.
  This encompasses ALL public and private channels (including Flame!)
  and anybody found harassing in such a manner shall not be welcome
  on this mud.{x

{VNOTE:{x Punishments for violators of the {Rc{Pensor rules{x will be determined
      on a case by case basis, but generally will be as follows:  1) 
      a warning {YFOD{x  2) a {bnochan{x/{bnonote{x  3) {G1{H2{G1{H2{x, {Tf{Creeze{x, or {Pf{Rr{Py{x.

0 GAMEIN  GAMEOUT~
You can use {CGAMEIN{x and {CGAMEOUT{x to check your current game entry and exit
messages. These messages can be set for you by an imm, at a cost of 50 qp
which entitles you both the gamein and gameout.
~

0 ENGRAVE  ENGRAVING~
Syntax: {Pengrave{x <{Ymessage{x>

Engraving is the art of etching a message into a weapon. It is intended to
show the history of some of the legendary weapons of Thera, but you could
also use it to write down the 'dirs to the bakery from recall', if you are
having trouble in that area. Engraving requires the use of special tools
which mortals can't get (yet), but which every jeweler has. In order to
minimize the wear and tear on these tools (which you can use for free, no
matter how uncooperative the jeweler), each person may only engrave one
message per weapon (and that's a short one, maximum 75 characters). You can
engrave it again, but that will overwrite YOUR first engraving (others may
put their own engravings on it). Also, you may not engrave a weapon you are
not worthy to wield... This is an artifact of the intended purpose, which
is to show who wrote their name in the history of Thera using this weapon.

To engrave a weapon, take it to any jeweler in the game (there are more
than you might have thought) wield it, and '{Pengrave{x <{Yyourmessage{x>'.
Thereafter, if you look at the weapon you will see that there are
'personal {Cengravings{x' on it, and you can '{Plook engravings{x'. If you have
more than one engraved weapon, you can '{Plook 2.engravings{x'. Your
engraving will look like this:

    [date] {Y<your name>{x <your title> engraved {Ythis{x:
     "<your engraved message>"

So you may want to have your title reflect something about your skill or
intent in making the weapon, as this will be recorded along with your
engraved message.

0 SPAM~
'{PSpam{x' is the name of a brand of canned meat, but that's irrelevant here.
Here in the MUD, '{Pspam{x' means unnecessary and annoying information. If
you {WGOSSIP{x something, then the whole MUD has to hear what you say. If you
{WGOSSIP{x the same thing repeatedly, then all those people have to listen to
all those things. Chances are you will be {Mannoying{x them. Remember that you
are not alone in the MUD, and consider what a mess your screen would be if all
the players were to do things that produce messages to the whole MUD. The same
thing applies if you {WSOCIAL{x a lot, or {WAUCTION{x all kinds of useless things.

If you bother a lot of people and don't notice it, chances are someone will
complain to you about it. When people complain, this should tell you you have
overdone it, whatever you did. You really should stop it at this point.

Remember that if courtesy is not enough to help keep you from spamming, then
the {YImmortals{x may have to take action against you. You can be warned, have
your communication channels turned off or even be banned. {CTake heed!{x
~

0 MOOCHING~
As in real life, there are players who accomplish a lot on their own through
hard work and using their head, and there are the {Ymoochers{x who loudly (and
often obnoxiously) beg everyone for help in getting experience, equipment,
gold or spell-ups. The clever workers and explorers get a lot more out of the
game, believe me! It's OK to ask for help if you get into unexpected trouble,
the helpful folks at Legacy will be happy to assist if they can. You can ask
for the occasional bit of information if you've tried to come by it on your
own and can't seem to find it. It's {Pnot{x OK to try to get people to help
you with every step because you're {Ytoo lazy!{x Check all these resources
before {Ywhining{x for help:
- You are born with a token for a {Cnewbie bag{x in your hand. If you give
  it to Deirdre, the Healer 1 north of the Temple of Mota (Recall), she will
  give you a newbie bag with useful equipment and helpful hints in it, even
  some food and drink.
- Other equipment and some silver can be gotten by killing mobs in MUD school
  and the Fair. The directions to the Fair are in the {CNewbie Bag{x.
- You are born with a map of Midgaard in your hand. There is also a {Cmap shop{x
  at the west end of Poor Alley, which runs a bit south of Main Street.
- Before you ask '{GWhere can I go to level?{x', try exploring on your own
  for a while! Check the list from the {RAREAS{x command for reference.
- If you do need to ask for help, be polite. People have their own characters
  to level here, and are doing you a favor by helping you.

0 PIT~

Syntax: {Cpit{x
        {Cpit{x <{Ymin_level max_level{x> <{Ykeyword(s){x>

The {Cpit{x command allows you to look into the donation pit.  Just as with
{Clook in pit{x, you must be standing by the pit in order to see inside.

Syntax examples:
   {Cpit{x           - shows you items around your level.
   {Cpit 15{x        - shows you items around level 15 ( 5 - 25, actually )
   {Cpit 10 20{x     - shows you items between levels 10 and 20.
   {Cpit axe{x       - shows you all items called 'axe' in the pit.
   {Cpit 45 sword{x  - shows you swords in the pit around level 45.
   {Cpit 20 40 axe{x - shows you axes between levels 20 and 40.

91 APPLICATION~
Applying for Immortality

The final step for any mortal is the assumption of immortal power. In order
to climb the last few steps to immortality, you must submit an application.
This help file will give you some direction as to the content of that
application.

First, what this application should not be:
Too long
Too short
A glorification of you
A diatribe of us
and, most importantly,
DO NOT BE VAGUE

What your submission must include:

1. Tell us what you have done.
Have you been a Clan leader? Can you code? Can you build? Have you coded
for us already? Have you been building for us in your spare time? Knowing
what you have done can help us picture what you will accomplish in your
immortality.

2. Tell us what you want to do.
Everyone has plans for the mud. Many applications address this point, but
we want you to understand the importance of your ideas. We want highly
motivated imms who know what they want to do and to not need to be told
what to do. If you do not tell us what you want to do, then it seems you do
not want to do anything.

3. Tell us how you want to do it.
This is the section where everyone has problems. Applicants talk about
changing the mud. They weave fine tapestries of gold and light to produce a
picture of the mud as it would be if they were an immortal. Then, they
forget to tell us how they plan to make their dream real. Every good idea
has a workable plan. You must tell us your plan or suffer from the sad
reality that we cannot read your mind.

Something your application can include:
Flavor/Personality
If you like to roleplay, write the note in character. Nothing is more
pleasing than to have an immortal who has personality. Write in your
accent. Use your mannerisms. We enjoy a good read as much as the next
person. A word of caution though: Do not overwhelm the intent of the paper
with your roleplay. The submission is there to be evaluated on your ability
to contribute to the mud, not how convincingly you can portray a down and
out blacksmith with only one hand and a lisp.

Remember:
This is just a *guide*. Do not follow this help file to the letter. You are
writing a paper that supports your bid for immortality. Our help file tells
you what general topics you need to cover in order to make a good
application. Just because you follow this help does not mean you will be
made an immortal, but it will definitely produce an application that is
more than and better than:
'I know a lot about the mud. Make me an imm'

0 ALIAS UNALIAS~
Syntax: {Ralias{x
	{Ralias{x <{Yword{x>
	{Ralias{x <{Yword{x> <{Ysubstitution{x>
	{Runalias{x <{Yword{x>

The {Ralias{x command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one command.
{RAlias{x by itself lists your current aliases, {RAlias{x <{Yword{x> lists the alias with
that name (if such exist), and {Ralias{x with both a {Yword{x and an {Yargument{x
produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to a new
command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.
~

0 PROPOSE ACCEPT REJECT BREAKUP ENGAGEMENT~
Syntax: {Cpropose{x <{Yplayer{x>
        {Caccept{x
        {Creject{x
        {Cbreakup{x <{Yplayer{x>

Before you can enter and enjoy the holy bonds of matrimony, you and 
your loved one must first become engaged.  The engagement can take 
place without the aid of an Immortal, and only requires you to first 
{Cpropose{x to the character in question.  They must then either {Caccept{x
or {Creject{x your proposal, depending on how they feel about the idea. 
If either person changes their mind, they may {Cbreakup{x at any time.
~

0 LEGACY SET IMMLEGACIES~

Besides the Questmaster, the immortals also will hold frequently hold
quests for your enjoyment.  You can collect a legacy set from any imm
using that imm's tokens.  The {BI{Cmm {BL{Cegacy {BS{Cystem{x is as follows.

There will be three types of tokens:

    {GHidden{x tokens, dropped randomly throughout the realm
    {VTrivia{x tokens, given for when trivia is held
    {YQuest{x tokens, as rewards for quests the imm holds

In order to receive a particular imm's legacy set, you must collect
fifty ({P50{x) of each token.  Sometimes, rare {Ww{Vi{Cl{Bd{x tokens might be 
available that count as any one.  Once you have collected the {P150
tokens{x, you turn it in to that particular imm, who will give you your
choice of {BL{Cegacy {BS{Cet{x.

{WNote: Imp legacies require 150 tokens, but in no particular assortment.
        The rule of 50 of each token does not apply.{x

1.{x A token for {Y1,000 {xquest points{x  ({Y2,000{x if it is an {BI{Cmp{B L{Cegacy{x)
2.{x A token for {G90 levels{x (2 tokens if it is an {BI{Cmp{B L{Cegacy{x)
3.{x {BTwo pieces of eq{x, ownered and designed by you, using the points system.
   The rules on ClanEQ will apply ({BI{Cmp {Bl{Cegacies{x will have their own unique, 
   pre-designed eq, if you choose this option)

{VGood luck!{x :)
~

0 EVOLVE~
Syntax: {CEvolve{x
        {CEvolve{x <{Yskill/spell name{x>

Evolution of spells and skills is a relatively new addition to Legacy,
where the players, through use of skill points are able to upgrade and
boost in power and effectiveness the skills and spells they have. Not
all evolutions will be able to occur in each class, as some are specific
to a given class due to the nature of the spell/skill. Typing evolve
will show the current status of your evolvable skills and spells, also
including any further skill points you may require to upgrade said skill.
Typing evolve with an argument will upgrade the chosen spell/skill if you
have enough skill points to do it. Please note, that you require a base
of 85% in the skill originally before you can evolve it further, and even
higher to evolve it again.  After evolving, you will need to practice
up the skill in question again.
~

92 EVOLVE 'EVOLUTION TABLE'~

Maximum evolutions allowed:

0 ALTERNATE ALTERNATES ALT ALTS~
An {Calternate{x, or '{Calt{x', is a character played by the same person as
another character.  This is allowed, and even encouraged, as part of the
fun is trying out classes and races that you may be unfamiliar with.  Many
players have more than one character, and most try to roleplay them
separately from their other characters.  This too is encouraged, many
find the challenge of roleplaying different characters stimulating.

Roleplay is not forced on {BL{Te{gg{Wa{Tc{By, but this should not be confused with
tolerance of making it difficult to roleplay.  Players work hard to keep
their alts separate, but alas, it is natural to blur the difference
between player and character.  People tend to familiarize themselves with
the player, and in doing so, often fail to treat their characters as
individuals.  Thus, many players do not reveal the identities of all their
characters.

If you know who a player's alts are, do NOT reveal them to others without
express permission from that player.  It is considered rude and extremely
bad etiquette, and is not tolerated on Legacy.  This applies to any form
of communication on the mud, including notes and channels.  {PPunishment{x for
revealing alts is swift and harsh.  Please, respect your fellow players,
don't destroy the possibility of roleplay for others.
