pilgrim~
Pilgrim~
A pilgrim welcomes your company.
~
The pilgrim is on a long journey to visit the holy city.
This looks a little like a cross between country peasant
and a holy man. On the pilgrim's finger is a small ring
that looks as if it was made of bone, whereas in his hand
is a rough looking staff that could probably double easily
as a weapon.

One of the thinest people you have ever seen, must be
staying alive by sheer will. Obviously a citizen from
the state of the clothing and the face that is covered
with the scars of so many beatings, this one probably
doesn't have too much longer to live.

black leather armour with a blue and a green dragon painted onto the front.
The Orc is armed with a nasty-looking weapon and a small buckler which
also has the dragons' images on it.  Recruited soon after the Demonesses
arrival, it is this soldier's desire simply to survive long enough to
retire with whatever reward Elvanshalee deems to give him.  For this
soldier, life would be reward enough.

Getting fed up with what he considered to be far too
easy jobs, he eventually came to join the army of
Elvanshalee. He was disappointed when he discovered
that she had no designs on the rest of the world but
at least his post allows him to do what he likes to
the locals.
Basher is quite a mean looking dwarf, his hair tied
into a pony tail behind his head, his face covered in
the scars of a dozen battles, a long slightly greying
beard reaches to his navel. Wearing heavy armour
pitted an etched from past conflict, Basher looks
a formidable opponent.

The citizen is wearing little more than rags similar to

He does however lack the scars and blemishes that the

adventured together before Elvanshalee's Alignment had
gone irrevocably Evil. Her favourite weapon is the stump
of a tree.
Blossom's hair is long and black and is tied up in a
pigtail which she has flung around her neck to give
possible opponents less to grab hold of. She wears but
light leather armour which has no distinguishing features.
On her feet she wears sandals.

Elvanshalee's property.
Not one to believe in wearing armour because it
impedes her movement, Daisy has instead settled for a
bright red well tailored dress, made from the loveliest
material she could get her hands on. Her hair is long
and flowing and black in colour, reaching halfway down
her back.

easily kill Kalana`s god. The two are old friends
going back a long way.
Wearing a heavy looking plate armour that has been moulded to fit her
body, and wielding a large nasty looking mace Kalana appears to be quite
a vicious looking opponent, her hair is short and her nails are long and
her eyes seem to flash with an almost evil light.

elvanshalee demoness~
Elvanshalee~
Elvanshalee sits on the throne here.
~
Elvanshalee was born of drow stock, but somehow made
her way into the ranks of the higher demons. She got
bored with the petty squables of the other demonlords
and so brought her small army to the surface to carve
out a small kingdom for herself. She has no designs
on the rest of the world but instead enjoys watching
the attempts of the heroes that try to oast her.
Elvanshalee wears little more than a skin tight black
suit designed not to hamper her limbs, Indeed she is
very thin and a lithe and even her hair has been closely
cropped so it doesn't get in the way when she fights.
Across her back is a longsword that appears as if it
was made on a private forge.

Knights make up the bodyguard of Charinida
and the most powerful of them are a match for

The Emerald Knights can be made up from any rank
of any of the main forces and it is an honour to
be selected as such a knight, only the prestige
of being a Sapphire Knight comes even close.
This particular Emerald Knight is Elven, and
unlike most of the armed forces whose armour is

Food Guard~
Food Guard~
Someone is standing here guarding the food.
~
The food guard is dooing exactly that
no matter how little food there is here
the food guard will die rather than
let anyone steal any
The food guard is dressed as a peasant
clothing covered in the dirt an grime
of the city overhead. Probably not a good
choice of person to guard the food considering
hygene. But then hygene isn't number one
on Elvanshalee's list either.

Resistance Leader~
The leader of the resistance wonders if you've come to help.
~
Not a lot to look at, wearing only the rags
that help him mingle with the civilians on
the streets on the city. The leader also
bears many scars given to him by the
soldiers of the demoness. He looks means
and ready to give no quarter.

Hole Guard~
Hole Guard~
A man is guarding the hole in the wall here
~
The closest thing to an actual soldier you'll
find in the caverns, he is dressed in the
armour that has been captured during the
odd skirmish with the demoness' forces.
the armour hence bears the design of the
Emerald and Sapphire dragons. He is standing
to attention keeping careful guard on the entrance
he will kill anyone he doesn't recognise first, and
then ask questions.

emerging from it's head. It is armed with a nasty looking
two handed sword. The creature's very body seems to be

You have entered the Great Hall. This is not an amazing
place by any stretch of the imagination, it is just a
place where guests of the demoness come when they are
hungry and want to eat, there is often a guest of two
here as there are no specific times set for the meals.
A large table stretches from one side of the room to
the other, with chairs positioned all around it, except
at the head. That place is reserved for the demoness
herself and she never joins her guest for meals. The
table is laid with the best cutlery and exquisite looking
candle holders. The diners are watched over by portraits
of various nameless people.

various tapestrys. In one corner sits a suit of armour
but the metal is so thin that you can`t help but
wonder how the wearer could hope to survive.
At various postions on the walls are small candle
holders, theses seem to be lit now and appear to
never burn down as there is no evidence of dripping
wax on the floor, the walls or even the candle itself.

cooks rush around here trying to prepare meals for the
guests of Elvanshalee and don`t have time to answer
your questions or indeed pay you any heed.
The kitchen is well equiped with all the most modern of
appliances, and the food lockers seem to be well stocked,
since only the guests of the demoness dine in the Great
Hall it is evident they are well looked after.

This used to be the shop from which the citizens

when the demoness took over she didn't like the idea
of all and sundry having access to weapons, so she shut
the place down in the most violent of ways.
The signs of the fight are still evident, and the
shopkeeper far from being given a decent burial was
left here to rot.
the official line is that the weaponshop owner had
started an underground movement against the demoness
Most say she hadn't giving him enough time to start anything.
