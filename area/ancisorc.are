a pair of disembodied eyes~
A pair of disembodied eyes stares at you.
~
A pair of disembodied eyes floats before you glowing white 
with an eerie, cold light. Eyes clouded over with the touch 
of death that watch you . . . . look at you . . . . stare at 
you. Their gaze transfixes you.  Feelings of ravenous hunger 
accost your mind.  A hunger for warmth. A hunger for life.

A shiny wet body writhes on the ground.  Bleeding and larva-like 
it carpets the ground with its greenish oozings.  Its twisted face

The figure of a human warrior rises up 9 feet from the ground.
Muscles ripple across the expanse of his brown-black chest.  An 
iron sword gripped in his right hand hangs over your head like an 
executioner's blow.  His polished metal body is cold to the touch.

Dalamar looks at you with a sinister grin on his face.

Dalamar's cool, violet eyes glide over your body.  Their almond 
shape belie his elvish ancestry as does his bronze skin.  His strong, 
muscular body fills out his black robes. His composed stature tells 
you that he does not fear you.  Dalamar scribes some sort of symbol 
in the air. A gong sounds.  Laughter fills the dark elf's eyes.

of his arms and chest. You hear the clatter of his great hooves against
the ground as he assumes his battle stance.

Raistlin mocks you with his sly grin.

Black robes of the finest velvet hang from the archmage's 
slightly stooped, thin shoulders. The robes fall in soft folds
around his slender body.  The hood covers his head, leaving all
but his golden eyes in shadow.  He leans upon a staff.  His 
slender gold-tinged fingers grip the haft of the staff with such 
force they almost look white.  The Master of Past and Present lets
out a wry chuckle as you turn your gaze away from him.

The gold dragon claw holding the crystal iscarved of the very heart 
of a vallenwood though it looks remarkably like a true dragon's claw so 
flawless is its crafting.  You discover that the dragon claw head holding 
the crystal fits over the tip of the maple shaft and is secured by thick 
coils of golden wire.  The maple shaft is shod with a dull grey metal cap 
that makes a slight ping as you tap it against the ground.

chair Gwynnian highback~
The craftsmanship of this chair holds you enthralled.  The 
twining bodies of the reddish serpentine dragons that form the 
armrests look so real you almost shiver.  The back is tall, narrow,
rectangular.  The seat is triangular with rounded corners.  Three 
legs of rope-like design support the chair.  A nagging sensation tugs 
at the back of your mind.  The chair doesn't look quite right.  
Something about the chair is . . . wrong.  Realization hits you like 
an avalanche. The chair seems sculpted from a large block of rosewood 
rather than pieced together from individual pieces of wood.  You search 
harder, but find no seams or joints.

Gate Hall~
Smooth, opaque stone forms the walls.  You notice no mortar lines.  The 
walls seem carved from a single block of black stone.  An empty sconce 
adorns each wall.  The ceiling towers above you, cloaked in shadow.  A 
light layer of dust coats the grey flagstone floor.  Your bones throb with
pain.

The hiss of whispers seems to encircle you.  Your bones throb with pain.
A faint musty odor fills the air.  A plain oak door leads west and another 
leads north.

Raistlin's Study~
A fire blazes in a huge, gaping fireplace across from the door.  A coldness 
pervades the air despite the fire.  The coldness seems to emanate from the 
hundreds of night-blue books that line the walls on the deep shelves of 
bookcases.  Large, plush chairs of the best fabric stand upon hand-woven 
carpets.  Carved wooden tables draped with objects rare and ghastly dot the
immense room.  A gigantic desk of black wood stands near the northern wall.  
A high-backed chair sits behind the desk.  Heavy, black velvet curtains 
hang down behind the chair.  A plain oak door leads west.

A Landing~
Smooth, opaque stone forms the walls.  Wide stone steps spiral up and down 
the staircases that lie in the center of the room.  An empty sconce adorns 
each wall.  The faint smell of smoke fills the room.  Your bones throb with 
pain.  A plain oak door leads west.  You realize that you can recall from 
this room.
