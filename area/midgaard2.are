    To whom it may concern,

        Merc Industries has installed a new no-rent save and quit
        system.  Apparently one can now save and quit at any time
        from anywhere inside a town or out.  My services here are
        no longer required.

The Temple Of Mota~
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Mota.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD
SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.
A large sign is hung by the paintings on the stone wall.

The Temple Square~
You are standing on the Temple Square. Huge marble steps lead up to the
temple gate.  The marble of the steps is highly polished and like most of 
the city the square is immaculate. There are also trees planted along the 
perimeter of the square to break the monotony of gleaming white stone. It 
strikes a nice balance between being imposing and warm.

  The entrance to the Clerics Guild is to the west and the city bank is to 
the east.  Just south of here you see the center of town, Market Square.

trees that line the road here, making it necessary to replace them every so

wishing to protect themselves from bad luck or misfortune with a 
representation of their favorite God. The unmistakable smell of new leather 
is emanating from a shop nearby. Occasionally some rather interesting people

the doorway of the diner.  No greasy spoons to be seen here-- the booth
walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood, rescued
from garage sales.  Most tables have chess boards carved and painted on their 
fingertip-smooth tops.  The light sounds of an elvish refrain blend with the 
dusty golden light and the wonderful smells to put you completely at ease.  
A huge picture window looks out over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads 
north onto the dock and the South Bank river landing, while the main entrance 
to the south returns you to Austral Square.  On most days you will find Kate 
here, testing a batch of stew or brewing a special pot of cinnamon coffee,
