Nevermore Keeper ~
The Keeper of the Secret~
Nevermore, Keeper of the Secret, stands guard at the entrance.
~
Nevermore, Keeper of the Secret, was the most powerful mage
of all before the devastation.  He had at his beck and call
hags, crones and harpies - numberless and endless, nourished
on the filth of graveyards and suckled on the rotting flesh
of battlefield corpses.  A war where sorcery is used is a
terrible thing, and can have devastating results.  He was
beaten back by Lotus, Lord of Evil, and although he was not
destroyed, he was left here in this form as a reminder to all
who would think they can overtake all and rule supreme.

around here. Play with all those {Wbones{x lying around, perhaps?
Looks like the former inhabitants of the tower used this hole
to push victims into and let them die. Many must have suffered this
fate judging from all that human {Wbones{x lying around.

A Beautiful Furnished Room~
You are standing in a beautiful furnished room in the {WAbandoned Tower{x.
When the former inhabitants left this building, they seemed to have
lacked the time to take all that neat stuff with them. Strangely enough,
there is no dust on the furniture nor is any of it rotten like all the
things in the other rooms you have seen so far. This tower might NOT be
totally abandoned after all.
An inlaid {Ywardrobe{x, a very big round {Rtable{x, {bbookshelves{x made from
expensive woods, a large {Ychest{x with Chinese inlay work and some other
stuff worth a fortune is standing here. What a shame that you don't have
the time or the strength to take any of those pieces with you.

He murdered the woman and buried her body by the river. In her
grave, the woman's golden hair grew until it surfaced and her
grave was covered by a field of swaying golden reeds. Shepherds
cut the curly reeds to make flutes, and when they played them,
the tiny flutes sang and would not stop singing.
 {Y"Here lies the woman with golden hair,
  murdered and in her grave, killed by the
  son of the coal burner because she wished to live."{x
That is how the man who took the life of the woman with the
golden hair was discovered, and brought to justice so all who
live in the wild woods were safe once more.

*DOH*  you were told to be careful...slipping off the {Gmountain{x
and crash landing in the deep sheltered {Gf{Yo{Gr{Ye{Gs{Yt{x will make for
a long walk back.  Oh well, at least you didn't die (small

    You have finally reached the bottom. Okay, decisions, decisions.
Which way now? You have several options, north, east, or west.
Good luck and "Happy Trails to You" ;)
