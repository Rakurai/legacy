Hwisprian~
Hwisprian, the {WWhite {BKnight{x clan physician, wanders among the wounded.
~
Hwisprian is here.  The teilysa wears a long robe and hood that shows
only a quiet and concentrated face. This aged cleric's days of battling
are over, and instead heals clan members in need of special healing.
Hwisprian is so well-versed in all skills and spells that you can also
heal, practice and/or train here.  Ask nothing else of Hwisprian;
casting spells takes great concentration.

Hostess Quickly~
Hostess Quickly wipes off her hands and smiles warmly at you.

Hostess Quickly is the best and most talented preparer of foods in
all of Thera. Some say she was born with a tablespoon and wearing
an apron! She has a sweet smell from her exotic elven perfume, but
also from spending all day in the Boar's Head, the clan mess hall,
and her face is powdery. As usual, she is intent upon fixing up a
sumptuous meal.

Falstaff is a boastful fellow, always regaling his fellows (those unlucky

for Annabus and the times when he saved the mayor of Midgaard from an attack.
He is a big man, with a blacksmith's arms and solid legs like an oak tree.

Davron blacksmith~
Davron~
Davron is here tending the fires and forging armor for Falstaff.
~
Davron is a brawny but relatively quiet man, with a pensive manner
that takes Falstaff's armor designs and truns them into artistry.
Davron somehow puts up with Falstaff's less than impressive tales
of tournaments and quests. His giant torso and strong arms carry
the scars from the battles of his youtha and the fires of his trade.
Over his smithy garb, Davron wears an Elven Black Mithril Jacket,
which protects him from the heat of the forge. Nearby his Sword
of Victory is sheathed in a huge Belt of Might, awarded him by
Sir William Rambone, Early of Rothshiem, after serving under him
for many years. Though not exactly retired since he arrived in
Thera, Davron prefers to forge armor to spinning tales in the
Boar's Head Tavern across the way.

fortress ~
The sturdy though plain design of the fortress shows to all the strong,
but concentrated intent of the {WWhite {BKnights{x to provide a haven for
their members.	The polished stone with which it is made brightens your
spirits. Except for the multitude of flowers and shrubs that grow around
the base and cascade down the top, this fortress is unadorned, as the
inhabitants would rather adventure, quest and help others than spend efforts
on symbolic decor.  Built to last for ages, this fortress serves many
generations of {WWhite {BKnights{x.

gyrfalcon falcon ~
The huge white falcons from the Arctic Woods have come here to guard
the fortress.  As they rest on tops of the walls, they survey the
surrounding lands.  Their keen raptor eyesight see Midgaard far to the
west, the mountains to the north and northwest and New Thalos just
beyond the Sands of Sorrow far to the east.

Courtyard~
    Just inside the entrance of the massive {Wfortress{x, the sounds of
people going about their daily business can be heard coming from all
directions. The mosaic {Wf{Cl{To{Bo{Cr{x has a beautiful pattern and sheen to it,
and everything about this fortress has an immaculate look and feel.
The center of the courtyard has an unusual {Wfountain{x that sparkles with
refreshing {Cwater{x. Sit here to relax on the benches that sit around the
edges viewing the fountain, or proceed with your tasks.

kneeling on the soft grass carpet, weapon in hand. Nature is standing
behind Beowulf, smiling kindly. Beside Nature stands Merona, her whip
coiled at her waist, and smiling like an angel. On the other side of
Nature stands Zenki with a gnarled staff in one hand and a black book
in the other. Kneeling beside Beowulf is Richard with black cape flowing
to the ground with his swords strapped to his back. You see a large
forest in the background.

sworn to protect the land with their very lives, willing to sacrifice
everything they have to prevent the corruption of the lands and

{WWhite Knight's Smithy{x ~
You are overtaken by a brief heat wave as you enter the smithy.
After you adjust to the hot climate and recover from your coughing
caused by the large amounts of smoke, you are able to look around.
The entire room is caked in soot and grime, which seems to be coming
from the large furnace located in the left section of the room. A
large, burly grime-covered man is tending the fire. He seems to enjoy
the heat as he works on forging armor for Falstaff. You'd best not
bother him, and get to your own work, it is mighty hot in here.
There is a sign hanging on the wall near the anvil which reads:
Welcome to the White Knight's Smithy!

The Masaki Shrine~
As you look around this room, you see many portraits. The first one
you notice is of a young-looking girl with long, pink, spiked hair.
Underneath the picture is a plaque that says "Washu". Next to that,
you see a picture of a tall girl with blond hair tied up with a red
ribbon in a ponytail in the back and the biggest eyes you've ever seen!
Under this picture is a plaque that says "Mihoshi". Then you see a
picture of a tall woman with long, dark green hair. Under this picture
it says "Kiyone". Next is a picture of a woman looking very much like
the first, only with blue hair instead of pink. Her plaque says "Ryoko".
After her is a woman with deep purple hair named "Ayeka". Right next to
that is a young girl with bright blue hair and a green diamond on her
forehead named "Sasami". Lastly, you see a creature hard to describe
with words, only that it looks like a brown rabbit, but with paws like a
cat and ears bigger than its entire body, and a red jewel in its forehead.  
Under it it says "Ryo-Ohki".  The walls are pretty much blank except for 
those pictures.

Nearby there is a bookshelf with all kinds of books the Dragon likes to read.

3rd Floor Landing~
As you stumble your way up to this marvelous place, the first thing you
notice is that THIS view is even greater than the LAST one!  Your sight to
the west sees FAR beyond Midgaard and the mighty forests that occupy the
area.  Looking south, you see past the mighty river, and if you look really
hard, you think you might see Mega City One.  Eastwards you see the mighty
city of Old Thalos and just to the north of that is the Fourth Tower.  And
finally as you glance at the northern sky, you see the Giant mountain that
leads to Olympus.  
Private rooms are down the hallways in every direction.

The cave is neat and tidy, except for the workbench lining one wall,
which is strewn with electronic parts and tools. As you move for a closer
look you notice that weapons in varying stages of completion are laying
on the bench, along with diagrams, tools, a small furnace, and a gem
polisher. Across the room is what could be called a kitchen, with an
electric oven, dishwasher, and a cupboard with various utensils. Boxes of
freeze dried food lay on the floor. A bed take up one wall, and above that
is a window cut into the rock and set with clear glass. Flourescent lights
flicker overhead, providing the only illumination for the room. The floor
is natural sandstone and has a hole cut into it in the far corner. Filling
te hole is a steel box, locked by a combination. The lid of the box is at
floor level. The only other thing that you notice in the room is the
brunette sitting at the workbench, studying diagrams.
