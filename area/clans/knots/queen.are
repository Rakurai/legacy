Lirrel healer~
A healer~
Lirrel, the {ga{ci{Wr{ge{x elemental of the Queen's Quarter Knot is resting here.
~
She is a sight to behold.  Her long white hair twinkles with the pearls
and crystals braided into it.  She sits atop a while marbled dais covered
with a thick blanket of pale blue down feathers.  You look up into her
opaque eyes, colorless but not sightless.  Her elemental power carries
information and knowledge by way of the gales and high winds.  Lirrel was
once the rational strand of the Knot, forever bringing her sisters down
to earth.  Both the younger and older Elementals come to her for advice
and consulting.  She smiles at you and beckons for you to come sit with
her.

Zein~
A trainer~
Zein stands here, hunched between two outcroppings of granite.
~
Staring down over the craggy faces of the Avadares mountains, Zein leans
his back against the sun-warmed stone and stretches.  He has been in Sadar
since the Last Battle, when the Fire Queen destroyed her sisters.  His
skin carries the markings of the trees and his clothing was of the old
style, muted earth colors of rust and brown.  His strong build and vast
knowledge in the art of warfare and magic makes him a great asset to the
Knot.

Nyctasia~
A shopkeeper~
Nyctasia bustles about cleaning up after the Elementals' lir.
~
Humming to herself, the beautiful woman sweeps the earthen floor.  Her
short black hair frames her face and reveals pointed pearl studded ears. 
She looks at you through sea green eyes and wonders what lir you will
choose as your lifelong companion.  Nyctasia is of the Namire, a race of
elves born of the treasured ocean.  If you look close enough, you can see
tiny gills behind her ears.  But these gills will never again feel the
ocean spray.  Not since her sister took her dolphin lir's life, and with
it Nyctasia's, has she felt the warm sands of a beach.

Aidan~
A shopkeeper~
Aidan is busy repairing the Elemental's gear and weapons.
~
When you look at Aidan, you clearly know what element he possesses.  His
bright red hair crackles with bright sparks.  Long ago in Oran, he fought
beside Cali and the rest of the Elementals against Queen Zorah and her
army.  He looks up and smiles at you.  His light amber eyes shimmer with
an inner glow.  He has come to Thera and joined the Knots to aid them in
their quest to balance the Land and also to bring a little of his own
mischief.

Aslynn~
The beautiful Aslynn sits here with Zein conversing.
~
Back against her sleeping black bear lir, Aslynn absently twirls a leafy
oak branch around her fingers.  Zein has apparently asked her a deep
rooted question and she is thinking on the answer.  The sun glow of her
skin would deceive anyone into thinking she was real to the touch.  Her
deep brown eyes light up as she jumps up with an exclamation.  She solved
Zein's puzzle, waking Drakke with a start.

Sebastian~
Sebastian is busy making the party their favorite specialty drink.

Blond hair and blue eyed Sebastian would charm any one woman with his
bright wide smile.  He was a member of the Regiment guard long ago, when
the Quarter Knot was ruled with the four strands.  But when Zorah
destroyed her rivals, he immediately denounced them and followed Cali to
Thera to begin anew.  Although he does not possess an element, he is by
far one of the most beloved of the clan.  He smiles at you and asks, "What
will you have my friend?"

	Many winters have passed since the tragic event which left a young 
human girl desperate and afraid.  Calvaria was barely twenty winters old 
when the evil Fire Queen Zorah, with her jealousy of the power of the 
coming Elementals and fear of them overthrowing her, sent a 
doppleganger of Calvaria's mother, Ladyhawk, into the wealthy merchant 
home to wreak havoc.  Coming to her beloved mother's dying cries, Cali
caught a glimpse of the fleeing intruder and let out a full chase only to 
fall in a long hard magical battle in the courtyard, for all to witness, 
including her bewildered and horrified father.  Exhausted and nearing 
execution, Cali tapped to the fire element she secretly held and 
disintegrated the doppleganger.  Watching on in disbelief, her father's 
sanity slipped from his grasp.  How could his own daughter kill his love?  
Screams coming from the flaming pyre chased Cali, as she raced back to her 
mother.  When she stumbled into the room, Cali was shocked to find no trace
of her mother's dying body.  The great seas raged that day as Calvaria wept
for her mother.
	Having nothing left after her father died, Cali and her wolven lir,
Manticore, left Oran with a band of Elementals to come to Thera.  But not 
before Cali got her revenge on the Fire Queen.  A massive battle roared 
between Cali's force and Queen Zorah and her Regiment.  The battle ended 
in a stalemate but not before Cali destroyed Zorah's defenses and took 
from her the one thing she prized the most, her beauty.  With all the rage 
and sorrow she carried with her, Cali unleashed a volcano of Flame to seer 
and leave Zorah's face scarred with etches of her Flamestrike.
	Along the hard journey to Thera, Cali lost most of her Elemental 
Comrades.  Feeling desperate and alone she gave her dead life up for 
living death and became an immortal vampire.  She dwelled with and lead 
the Kindred vampires for a time, until Manticore returned to her and 
reminded her of the real purpose of her existence.  Now she leads the 
great tribe of Elementals in hopes of putting a new Queen's Quarter Knot 
into the cycle.

	Oran is the birthplace of the Queen's Quarter Knot.  On the morning
of the Day of the Blessing, Month of Balance, identical twins were born to 
a wealthy merchant and his lovely wife, Ladyhawk.  When a friend of the 
family, a Seer, told the proud parents that both their daughters held 
Elements, they were afraid they might have to give them up or hide them.  
But when he told them that not only did they hold Elements, but between the 
two, they possessed all four,  Ladyhawk started to sob to herself.  How 
can she hide one baby from the Regiment let alone two?  Queen Zorah would 
definitely send her Seers out to destroy her babies, if she found out.  
Tears rolling down her cheeks, Ladyhawk came to the hardest choice she 
would ever make.  She delicately covered each baby girl in a blanket and 
put them side by side in their bassinet and told the Seer friend to come 
pick one of the babies and take her far from them and raise her.  Ladyhawk 
watched as the Seer, without revealing which child he took, rode off.  She 
and her husband walked into the nursery to unwrap the tiny girl to reveal 
her bright white curls.  The tiny baby reached over to where her sister 
was lying and started to cry as she realized the spot was empty.
	So that is how it came to pass.  Aerylene was taken from her 
family and was raised far outside of Oran.  When she grew old enough, her 
lir Bailey, a winter lynx bonded with her and told her where she can be 
reunited with her mother and other half.  So together they journeyed to 
the realm of Thera to be with them.  Each twin equally powerful:  Calvaria 
with her fiery temper and soothing gentleness, and Aerylene with her 
nurturing friendliness and graceful personality.  But together their four 
elements and the Queen's Quarter Knot will bring the Fire Queen's reign 
to an end.

Ilyatha came from the Land of Endless Night.  The sun never shone and the
moon never rose.  It was always dark so the people who lived there adapted
to the darkness.  She lived in a shadow-people village where she grew up
learning the skills of a warrior and the ferocious personality that the
shadows pride themselves in.  During an attack on another clan of shadows
Ilyatha saved some children because she felt sorry for them.  For this she
was named an outcast, never to be allowed to return to her clan or village.
She left the Endless Night Realm in search of adventure and a society
that could deal with compassionate warriors.  She found a town where people
liked you for who you were, not what you looked like or what your race was.
She also found a clan that helped her increase her self security and to
regain friends she had to leave behind.

Danzig is a shadowy figure, standing about 5 feet 9 inches.  He was born
in Lodi, New Jersey in 1957 when the fast cars and slick backed hair was
in.  His long black hair was slicked back, but not until '78 when the
forming of his first band, The Misfits came about.  Driven by old horror
and science fiction movies and comic books, the Misfits performed classic
punk at its finest.  Unrelenting desire for control lead to Danzig's
departure of the band, to form the devil lock wearing band known only as
Samhain. This short lived venture eventually became the present day band
which took the founder's name.  If you see him, the relatively short, yet
extremely muscular man might tell you:

"I was born in the dirt, I never had no home, and the places I've lived
you don't want to know. But if you wanna hear evil, just come a little
bit close."

A storm was brewing; everyone in Thera felt it.  The air which is
normally clean and pure was filled with tension, thick and electrifying.
Calvaria, barefooted, stood on the white sand just out of reach of the
crashing waves, staring intently to the east.  The dark, black waves
crashed violently on the rocks that jutted out of the small, secluded
cove.  The alcove, which only her mother and she knew of and frequently
visited when her mother was alive, was Calvaria's soul's revitalization
spot.  The mist filled the air, as the wind intensified its rhythmic beat.
Calvaria's sharp eyesight caught the lone figure approaching at a fast
pace.  They are trying to outrun the incoming storm she thought; they seek
shelter and I will accommodate.  A feeling of familiarity crept into
Calvaria, first her sharp mind, then her broken heart.  As the lone, dark
figure drew nearer, Calvaria's keen sense of intuition took over.
Suddenly, her eyes sparkled, even in the foreboding darkness.  A smile
appeared, with shoulders straight and squared, she slowly, hesitantly at
first, started walking towards the direction of the lone figure
approaching.  Could it possibly be she wondered, exactly what she had
prayed, and deeply longed for all these lonely years.  Cautious now,
because she didn't want to dispel the hope that had taken hold of her
heart, then faster, breaking into a smooth run when she actually saw the
face.  She cried out to her mother against the full force of the
unyielding winds trying to hold her back.  But never could that happen,
~

not now, not when Calvaria was this close to being re-united with her
mother, Ladyhawk.  Ladyhawk sat erect in the saddle seeming to be a part
of the huge, golden beast who kept prancing around as if to his own beat.
Ladyhawk floated to the ground and raised her slender arm, touching the
pure white, flowing mane of the stallion with her small hand.  She
whispered soft words into the laid back ears of the golden stallion,
quieting him immediately.  The soft melodious voice of his beloved
mistress was music to his ears.  He calmly stood waiting for her future
bidding.  Ladyhawk turned, the dark green, velvet hooded robe she wore,
swirled around her slender body.  Grasping Calvaria tightly in her arms,
Calvaria cried out to her mother.  I thought you were dead, I saw you
killed in the courtyard by the doppleganger.  Ladyhawk pulled her young
daughter ever so close, their faces touching, their tears of joy mingling
together.  For one brief moment in time remembered, air, earth, flame, and
sea stood still as the two clung to each other.  Ladyhawk slowly drew her
head back so she could gaze upon her loving daughter.  Ahh she sighed,
could it be she thought, that so much time has past her young daughter
was clearly before her, a beautiful young woman.  Ladyhawk drew a short
breath, her large, round green eyes flashed bright, a delicate smile
appeared.  Time had been good to her daughter, had it been as good to me
she wondered.  She released Calvaria from her tight, loving embrace, took
her small hand and led her to the rocks so that they could sit awhile.
~
E
page10 page 10~
The wind was picking up Ladyhawk's long, blonde tresses that peeked out
of her hooded robe, tossing them lightly here and there.  Calvaria noticed
this and reached up to brush a single wisp back from her mother's face.
The gentle fact I remembered Calvaria thought.  Calvaria's voice quivered
as she told her mother she didn't understand what had happened on the
fateful day.  Come let's sit and I will explain all to thee, gently
replied her mother.  No, cried out Calvaria, a violent storm is coming
and we must seek shelter.  Ladyhawk turned, raised her arm straight up
and pointed to the heavens.  She softly whispered "Be silent, be calm, be
as you were for Calvaria and me."  The clouds rolled away quickly, allowing
the full moon to cast its spell upon the calmed sea, twinkling, dancing,
fairy lights.  Calvaria giggled politely at her mother.  Never ceasing to
be amazed at Ladyhawk's grandeur, a woman surely not to be reckoned with
Calvaria thought to herself.  Ladyhawk turned to her daughter and said
that what she had to tell Calvaria would not be pleasant for her ears to
hear, her sharp mind to comprehend, nor her heart to accept.  Calvaria's
eyes widened, tilting her head slightly, she nodded.  The woman you saw
slain in the courtyard by the doppleganger, said her mother, was my twin
sister, Titan Arianna.  She was madly, and I do not say that lightly, in
love with your father.  Since his heart and soul belonged to me, Titan
Arianna's heart became black with jealously.  She plotted my death in order
to take my place by your father's side.  She summoned me to her place in
~

Jarradine on the pretense of making amends for her jealousy.  The
doppleganger was suppose to have overtaken me on the high road to Flaming
Five.  My luck -- dopplegangers are very stupid killers.  Titan Arianna
came into the courtyard just as the doppleganger was flying over heading
towards Flaming Five.  Naturally the dumb beast mistook her for me and
killed her.  I, however, was taken hostage by the slobbering, menacing
tribe of trolls called Pointerswest.  Normally they would not have
bothered me, but their King's son was ill and legend has it that he could
be cured with a lock of blonde hair.  They swiftly carried me underground
and kept me locked in a cage.  No harm came to me since the King commanded
that I be treated royally for I had saved his son's life.  Royally, laughed
Ladyhawk, in a dark, smelly cage underground all these years.  But how did
you manage to escape questioned Calvaria.  Ladyhawk smiled and said it was
all due to a wonderful mage named Suntzu.  He happened to be coming here
to visit you;  you stole his heart and yet he never set eyes upon you,
said Ladyhawk.  He's a young mage who works magic for the good of all.
Calvaria thought for a moment, Mother, have I seen him, she questioned.
No, for you would surely remember and never forget his kind, gentle face.
His smile is warm like an early summer's day that warms your face.  His
hands are strong, but yet disciplined.  His walk is with purpose, but not
arrogant, nor boastful.  His build is of medium stature; however, do not
be deceived of his strength. His manner of dress is somewhat peculiar for a
~

page12 page 12~
wizard, but then his active imagination knows no boundaries.  His robe is
orange with embroidered gold threads weaving five gold stars down the right
side and nine planets on the left.  His most potent talisman is a mystical dark
ruby worn upon his right hand.  But his eyes are what you will remember most,
 blue/green that twinkle with mirth.  His heart is his own, true, loyal, and
honest, which he guards well.  A commitment to him is for life, not to
be taken lightly.  Suntzu heard the troll guards talking loudly.  He was
invisible as he often is when he walks unfamiliar road, his sense of
security I guess, said Ladyhawk.  He stopped to listen, not an eavesdropper
mind you, but curiosity is within us all, smiled Ladyhawk.  He heard of my
plight and being the person he is, decided to teach the trolls a lesson as
well as helping me out of my dilemma.  He cast a spell upon the troll
guards and walked straight through the rocks, weaving in and around the
narrow passageways to find me.  He recognized me from various descriptions
given to him long ago.  And also for obvious reasons, I couldn't have been
mistaken for one of those ugly, warty, dirty, squatty trolls, laughed
Ladyhawk.  He decided then to take me under his protection.  He cast a
spell for the seas to rage and the winds to swirl.  He stole the key and
unlocked my cage just as the rivers underground began to swell.  He became
visible for one brief second.  I smiled and thanked him and pledged that
if I could do anything in return to only bid it so.  He bowed low, nodded
and smiled, then waved good bye.  His parting words were "For Calvaria, 
m'lady."  I ran to the swelling river and dove in deep under the water,
swimming for my life.  I emerged in the sea on the other side of the
Flaming Five Mountain.  There on the shore was my beloved steed, Cresque,
waiting impatiently to bring me straight away to you.  No love is greater
than mine for you.  Calvaria took her mother's hand and placed it to her
cheek wet with tears.  You're home she whispered in the dark, the Flame
burns bright, the Sea our memory.

As a young boy, I grew up in the nation of Yayalys and enjoyed peaceful 
existance in the surroundings of nature. I learned of the nature of the 
Elements and how they work together to support all existance. I became 
intersted in the mysteries of the Wind and learned among the Elemental 
Wizards of Wind.  Having mastered the skills necessary, I became their 
student.  This continued for 5 years until the people began to expand. 
Progress was appearing and I had no problems with this. Until, the 
appreant disregard for the land became evident. I brought the matter before 
the Elemental Masters, hoping the could do something about the problem. 
Either they couldn't or wouldn't be either way the problems contiued. I 
decided to set out on my own in hopes to reverse this destructive path. My 
efforts where met with stiff opposition and I was banished from my home.
I gathered my spell books and  books from my training and set out to find
those who also cared to protect the very nature we need to survive.  I 
searched many worlds, finding none who truly cared. Then, I came to Thera.  
My research on the people here turned up a group, yours, the Queen's Quarter 
Knots.  After reading that a very servant of the elements has turned evil,
I felt that I must join this group. Bad enough when a normal mortal 
destroys nature, but an element turning against the others would lead to 
total destruction.  Coming to that realization that even chaos needs the 
elements to survive and the world would be just a big void, I decided to 
act, to protect, and to join those who share my ideals.  I joined the 
Quarter Knots.  My element of choice is Aire.  My lir would be the graceful
sylph. Calm yet willing to defend with their life.  True to my element, I 
often do my own thing, yet will work for the greater good of the Elements.

Aeris, Mystical Guardian of the Elements.

Human. Vampire. Necromancer. Legend.

Dakkon Blackblade's life was simple enough. He was a wandering adventurer,
always on the lookout for treasure and magical artifacts. He wasn't
wealthy by any stretch of the word, but he did live comfortably, had good
friends, and a healthy sense of adventure. But that would soon change..

One day, while exploring the catacombs that ran deep under Sadar's Keep,
Dakkon stumbled upon a hidden door that led deep into the earth. No one
had traversed this path in centuries, the air still with death. In the
ancient caverns, he found the signs of a battle fought long ago, bodies
strewn everywhere. He took what little treasure he could find, and
consecrated the corpses to give them a semblance of a proper burial.
He was about to leave and venture back up, when he noticed a small room
at the very edge of the cavern. His torchlight flickering against the stone
walls, and against a jet black sword hanging on the wall on the far side
of the room. Dakkon had never seen such a fantastic sword, fell with
magical runes, surely it would aid him greatly in his adventuring! 
As he gripped the sword and measured its heft in his hand, a clawed 
hand shot from the ground where we was standing, and began to pull him 
under. As he feebly struggled against the preternatural strength dragging
him down, he heard a cold voice in his head speak to him, "If you like my
possessions so much, then become one of them!". Dakkon screamed as he was 
swallowed by the earth.

Consciousness came back to him slowly, he blinked his eyes and found
himself lying on the floor of the small room. Almost immediately, his
gaze was met by a tall man who was standing over him, wearing clothes 
of the darkest black, and an imperious look about him, as if he was of 
royal descent. "I am Baron Sengir", spoke the man, "and I have not fed in
quite some time. Arise, my minion, and serve me." Slowly, Dakkon understood
the enormity of his situation. He checked his pulse and found none. He found
the vibrant color of life in his skin was replaced with the cold pallor of
a corpse. He was not dead, but he was not quite alive either. Enraged at
Sengir for turning him into an abomination of nature, he lept at him,
dark sword still in hand, and impaled the surprised Baron on his own sword.
Baron Sengir's body convulsed in agony as black ichor oozed from the fatal
wound. "Fool.., I have granted you immortality, and this is how you
repay me?", were the last words of the dying vampire, before he collapsed
into a pile of dust.

Waiting until nightfall, Dakkon retrieved the ensorcelled sword and made
his way to the surface. Never again will he see the sun rise or its warm
caress on his face. Never again can he see his once friends, who would
see him as a monster. Dakkon would travel alone for years, every feeding
slowly eating away at his tormented soul. He was a monster, yet more
human than the beast that changed him. His still heart longed for
companionship, his soul called out into the night for someone. And one

Alexia awoke suddenly from the screaming of strangers.  She was confused
and lost.  She knew not where or who she was.  Did she have a home?  A
family?  She had so many questions with no answers.  After many years of
searching for her lost family, she decided to start a new life elsewhere. 
Alexia had heard of a place not too far away called the Dizzy realm, and it
was here that she called home.  Not too long after she entered these realms,
she found a friend to confide in.  He helped her find a new life and
friends; and they quickly fell in love.  They got married and built the
Dizzy Knights, to fight Lotus' evil ways out of Thera.  When things started
looking better in these realms, Kefta decided it was time for him to fight
the battles of evil in other realms...  And not long after he left, Lex
realized he would never return.  She mourned for him with all her heart and
soul.  No matter where she went, she just seemed to get sadder each
second...  Until her eyes showed no happiness at all.  Now, her eyes were a
deep red, as if she herself were dead.  She tried to concentrate on keeping
his clan strong, but realized that through all of the sadness, it was just
too much for her.  She then fled Dizzy, trying to run from the utter
loneliness she felt.  But not long after she left, she felt something draw
her back to these realms, and she returned, still saddened, but slowly
healing.  She was shocked to see the Dizzy Knights in shambles, but did not
rejoin them to raise them again.  The Dizzy Knights were a part of her
past...  As was her darling Kefta.  Ali then concentrated herself onto
helping other people; making new friends within all of the clans.  Within
these friends, she met Asmadi.  He was very different from anyone else, but
she was drawn to him in many ways.  He helped her grow, train and fight; he
was always quick to save her when she needed help.  They fell in love and
married; And on their wedding day, her eyes lost their deep redness, finding
their shinyness again.  Asmadi, along with some deep friends of hers
(Calvaria and Jello) introduced Alexia to the QtrKt clan.  It was here that
she truly found her home.  And now, from here and out, Asmadi and her are
together, sharing their love with all of their clan members, and helping
others when they need it.

Born the runt of a fairly large litter, Tiddles was a nobody a nothing. Yet even at a very 
young age there was something possibly even supernatural about him. Tiddles had a strange 
affinity for water and was given command of a hunting party whenever they had to cross the 
great river that passed through their land. However once across the river he'd hand back 
command of the group to his elder brother who he always thought of as being far more capable 
than he. Then during 1 particular hunt the party was attacked by a family of rather large bears 
and decimated. Tiddles and his elder brother lay amidst the dead. Yet shortly after Tiddles' corpse
and all that was on it was no where to be seen. Tiddles came back to consciousness in a small 
room dominated by a large fountain pouring blood. His own corpse lying beside him Feeling a 
little better than a grave robber, Tiddles took the equipment from his corpse and proceeded to 
look about his new home. It was a short while after this that Tiddles made new friends
and colleagues and he began to gain slowly in power as he tried to learn all he could.
Then one day he awoke to find himself lying in a coffin. Well he knew some of his new friends 
were vampires, but he hadn't expected this. Checking his neck he found two small swellings
Checking himself in the mirror he was disturbed to discover that the mirror wasn't working properly
there was obviosusly something wrong with it, it was no longer reflecting. Tiddles eventually joined 
to the creature that would become his lir, a red fox. A he became a lir himself for a short
while until his mistress dumped him for another.

Kismet was always quite an entertainer. He could amuse young and old alike 
with his vivid imagination.  Everyone thought his dreams and stories we so 
wonderful and that he could make a career of it.  Sadly, his parents did not 
share the same view and wished him to continue the family business.  So when 
he came to me and wished to sneak out of town when I was to depart as well, it came as 
no surprise.  He was barely 17 years of age and knew little about swordplay. Magic was 
definately not his bag as he was not much of a scholar like myself.  The boy had something 
about himself though and I knew he could do more for his life in the town of Midgaard than 
he could at his old home.  I taught him a what little i knew of swordplay and the arts of 
healing which i had gotten through my prayers and faith.  He spoke highly of joining a 
noble cause and bringing enjoyment to those he came in contact with.  His talents were 
best in his words for he could barely hold a sword to a bear as we traveled the countryside. <chuckle>
The look in his eyes as we neared the city told of his eagerness to explore the "new world".
It saddened me to leave him at the gates of the city, but I was confident of his abilities to 
adapt and to make friends.  I was more than pleased to hear of his sucess and share of few 
words of what I knew of him before he became part of your family.  Hopefully he is as joyful 
to you as his was to me. Maybe if I'm lucky we'll cross paths again.
As Kismet always says, "Best of luck to ya, till then..."

Long Ago, in a land far removed from ours, there is an island of mighty god
forged magic.  On this island live the Dragons.  The dragons withdrew from
the lands of men and elves to this isle, in order to let the mortals live
their lives without interference Not too many years ago 2 of these dragons
had a son, A small dragon they named Quasar, which means 'Star-born' in the
dragon tongue.  Quasar's mother was a dragon warrior who served with the
Elite guard, those special few dragons who defended the isle and its people. 
Quasar's father was one of their most powerful dragon mages.  One day,
Quasar's father simply disappeared.  The dragons searched high and low for
him, but he was never found.  Some say that the old dragon mage was
exploring another plane of existence.  Others say he was destroyed by a
spell too powerful for him to control.  Quasar's mother was killed when the
Elite Guard defended the island against an invasion of rebellious dragons
who sought to conquer the mortal realms.  
	This left poor Quasar an orphan.  So sunk in his despair and
loneliness, he hung around his family cave and refused to speak or leave. 
Several times this poor dragon wondered why he didn't end it all.  Then one
day, he wandered into his father's study.  He had always been forbidden to
enter before, but since his father wasn't around, Quasar didn't think it
mattered.  In the center of the room, was a pale blue, swirling mist. 
Quasar stepped into the mist, and was suddenly somewhere else.  He found
himself in the woods on the outskirts of the city of Midgaard.  He roamed
around for months, despairing, living in the woods, and stealing from
peasants.  Quasar found that he enjoyed both magic, a trait he picked up
from his father, and that he had sticky fingers, probably due to his dragon
heritage.
	One day, as Quasar rummaged in the woods, his keen ears heard
footsteps.  He peeked out from the brush and saw a lady there.  A beautiful
lady with alabaster skin, Ebony hair and ruby red lips.  Fangs glinted in
the moonlight.  An aura of sadness surrounded her, and Quasar, being a small
dragon Shrank back with fear.  The lady spied him and spoke in a soft,
musical voice.  "Hello there, little dragon.   What brings you here?"
Quasar could understand the language of mortals, for that was a gift of
dragons, but hadn't been taught to speak it.  All he could do was eep
softly.  "My name is Calvaria.  Do you have somewhere to stay?  " The lady
picked up Quasar and hugged him gently, Quasar trembled violently, then
calmed as he realized this vampire meant him no harm.  He began to purr
softly and licked her face.  Calvaria took him into her household, taught
him to speak, and kept him as her son.  And so the story continues...

First I was born. 
I was very young at this time and remember little
though I have reason to believe I was hatched from
an egg left under a gooseberry bush by a stork
that later went on to become famous for it's 
margarine monopoly. 
I went to school again at a very young age, the other
children didn't understand me. I was the only 
feral there. 
Even back then though I knew I'd be something
special. And when the other children in the 
school didn't understand when I explained to them
the joke about the black cat in a snow storm. I knew
my intellect was superior.
Later that same day, I started work at a milleners
I had no idea what I was supposed to be doing there
though and eventually left when I decided my pay
was more than my ability.
Then came that fateful day I got married to a 
a gooseberry bush. I guess I'd always had a thing
about gooseberry bushes because my mother was one.
but the marriage didn't last and I got a divorce
when she ran off with a wild strawberry.
Then I found a new family. And Calvaria, while not
really describable as a gooseberry bush does make
a very good substitute and leader of the family along 
with Tiddles, Dakkon, Alexia and Kismet. None of whom
are gooseberry bushes either. 
I am very happy now with my new family and with my Lir
a glass of advocat, some have said I can't have
a drink as a lir, but I feel we are well suited 
and have been together nearly three minutes now.
Also theres Kwesterriforum, my pet tiger. 
Many have claimed he's just a lion with a paint
covering, but it's just a tiger thats been a little
clumsy with it's decorating.

Something had been  brooding all day long. Toward the evening the pressure 
rose to almost  unbearable tenseness, water was smoking and there was fire 
in the sky as all came to a climax ....

The few people the  inhabited Thera's North Eastern parts, looking up, saw 
an enormous flash far off in the sunset. Followed by a large tail of fire,
something plunged towards earth and crash-landed in a shallow lake.
All that was left of whatever came from wherever was some twisted metal in
the  midst of  which the  bravest few of the Therans, who came to see what 
strange things had  befallen Thera this time, found a baby wrapped in some 
rags.

One of them  took pity  for this baby and fostered him. Knowing no name to 
call  the baby, the crowd that had gathered by that time suggested to call 
the baby  {PMartijn{x  as that was  the only inscription the could find on the 
rags.

He grew up to become a  strapping young lad  with a fiery spirit. Quick to 
laughter, steadfast in friendship and always  rushing into new experiences 
and kicks. There were no really striking differences with the other kiddo's 
that he grew up with.  Maybe the  only thing  was his feeling for justice, 
always standing up for his views and believes.

What started rumors about him was his never-ending search for, as the locals
called it, loudness. His great interest in arts, performing and listening to 
music preferably, was something disturbing to the uncultivated folks he lived 
with. Drumming on the tables in class was his favorite business in school, 
much to the teacher's discomfort, except for the arts teacher that is.

As years progressed slowly, just flowing with the flue in these distant parts 
of Thera, he grew less and less satisfied with his living. Being aware of the 
resistance the community still showed to him and having no untrodden paths 
for days and days around he set out to find new scenes and sounds.

After long wanderings he heard some faints whispers of music torn by the winds.
He found some amazing scenes and sounds and stared in wonder at the things
that happened at the fair. He met all kinds of folks, which were at least not 
directly showing to back away at his presence. He heard about lots and lots of
far away places where other kinds of music where made. He found some bits of 
all of them at this fair and nearby in Midgaard. The city which he soon 
embraced and started calling home. He used this as a basis for more and further
exploration of Thera in search for this last perfect note.

He met with some souls he felt connected to. They helped him in his adventures.
They gave him support, for the first time in his life he didn't have to learn 
everything the hard way, through trail and error, all by himself.

He joined his spirit with the forces of the Queen Quarter Knots. He hopes to 
be of some help in restoring the harmonious balance into Thera once more, 
uniting all elementals they were meant to. 

For now, he has settled himself a bit within Midgaard trying to get his own
balance, seeking all knowledge he can gain in this metropolis. Sorting out 
all things that have been happening, all sounds he heard, all vapors he 
smelled and all flavors he tasted during his long travels. Perhaps this might 
once lead him to his escalator to the regions of the sky where he cam from.

Far beyond the lapping shores of the sea, beyond perils many, there lies
a land of dragons, large and small. Separated from the rest of Thera by the
ocean for 1000's of years, the dragons of the land beyond the shining sea
grew into a noble race. Soon the fair sons and daughters of the dragons
forgot their cousins on the other side of the sea. Legends only they
became, tales to be told around the fire ring, when the dragons gathered in
celebration at the Feast of Fires every 7th year. In the 452nd Feast of
Fires the dragons were gathered in the air above the land, preparing to hunt
and there arose a sudden storm of such fury that it scattered them all like
leaves. Not even two were left side by side or within sight of each other. 
Many of the smaller dragons were never seen again in that land. Even some
of the larger ones were hurt seriously, or did not return. The gathering for
the Feast of Fires among that dragon race is now known as the Rending Time
in remembrance of the loved ones, the draglets and elders that were lost in
this storm. Of those lost, scattered by the storm was a small red dragon
called Cinnamon.  

When the storm's fury was unleashed, more terrible than any storm ever
remembered before among the dragons, who were lords and masters of the air
and fire themselves, Cinnamon was torn away from her family by a sheer of
wind. Tossed by the wind, buffetted and cast about, the small dragon struggled 
to right herself and fly, but the winds were far too strong and she had to 
fold up her wings to keep them from being torn away by the fierceness of the
storm. Perhaps luck, or maybe even pity of the Gods spared her life. A 
tumultouous blast of wind thrust the small dragon up above the storm, casting 
her out like the human legend of Jonah from the fish's mouth... 
Up.. up.. up.. till she was slammed into the fast moving current of icy air
that circles Thera.  Once she was caught within it.. Cinnamon could not escape 
it till she was far beyond her fair homeland. Eventually she tumbled out of it,
and was dumped in the ocean, exhausted and battered. Somehow the little dragon 
made it to shore and laid on the beach as if dead for several hours. Nearly a 
month she hid in a cave near the beach where she had come ashore untill 
finally, she began to wander a bit farther each day. On one such day of 
wandering, she met another dragon, Quasar... whom she eventually married. She 
is mostly happy here.. but misses her family. Perhaps someday, she will find 
them.

{CIn the begining (actually this is WAY after the "begining", if you really
want to know what happened in the "begining", go to the Bible and go to the
first page (for Jews and Christains) or go to the Koran if you are Islamic,
if you are Hindu or Buddist, there was no "begining" silly!  You should know
that *whap*) Ok, enough with the "begining" stuff. So anyhow there was this
Czar (of Russia) and his name was Ivan, and Ivan wasn't too nice, but he's
important because he advanced Russia a little. Ok, so now it's 1983. The
U.S.S.R. is just begining to start to not be so good. Then, out of now
where, this guy in a a suit walks into Red Square. The Sovites had just made
a man called Billy leader for the day. The man in the suit charges the elite
shouting "You damn red bastards!!!!" And starts busting some Kung Fu moves
out. In the end of the day Billy, was smited, as well as most of the Sovite
Elite. Never knew about this bit of Russian History? Most people don't.
Anywho, the Sovites deported the man in the suit to a land far far away...
The man's name was Kvass and the adventure continues today...{x

Once, a long time ago, there was an old mage named Ozzie *for short*. He was 
a wise mage. Everyone came to him for spells, and his wisdom. He had a young 
apprentice with him that helped him with his work. Her name was Jello. Jello 
has been with him for years, studying his ways, and applying them to her own 
ways. She decided one day, that she was ready to be on her own. She said her
goodbyes to Ozzie and took off to a ship that was docked.

As the ship set sail, she wondered..what is waiting for me in the land of
the unknown? What will I see? Whom shall I meet?
 
She waited on the ship for what seemed like days, then she heard the crew 
members speaking about this new land called . ..  THERA.
Soon, the ship docked, and Jello stepped out onto this new land. She wandered 
around town, doing odd jobs for folks to earn her keep. Then she met these 
strange but nice women name Calvaria and Alexia. Calvaria talked with Jello 
for a bit and then invited her to come join a clan that she belonged to.
All three women walked along a path and soon came to the entrance to what
was to become Jellos new home. The Quarterknot's clan hall.
Calvaria and Alexia wrapped their arms around Jello in a loving embrace and
said "Welcome to our family." With a warm smile, Jello walked through the 
door... And the rest is history. :o)

{TBorn into a soldier's family, Radiant grew to know the art of the sword
at an early age.  Training under his father, legendary Commander Zaknafein
Silvermoon of Solace, he became a master swordsman.  After years of peace in
Solace, trouble rose its ugly head.  At first it was a few, but soon
hundreds of skeletons, and zombies stalked around town.  Killing innocents. 
Radiant, his father, and the twenty knights of Solace armed for war.  The
war came to Solace with horrible speed.  The army of the undead attacked the
small town, and it's 20 guardsmen were beaten.  Only Radiant and his father
survived to fight on.  The two knights fought bravely, and won their way to
the stronghold of the Vampiric Master of the hordes.  Father and son,
Standing side by side, prepared to fight this corruption of humanity, but it
wasn't to be.  The Master was beyond quick, he moved like lightning, with a
sick smile, he ran his fist through Zaknafein's heart, swiftly ending the
famed warrior's life.  Radiant screamed with rage and sorrow.  With a
skillful slice of his sword, he slit the Vampire's chest open, but it seemed
the Master hadn't even noticed the wound, which would've killed a mortal. 
The Master Vampire laughed, a cold hard laugh.  "Come child, honor me with
your blood".  The fight was on.  Radiant was fast, and as skill with a sword
as any human ever to walk Thera, but the power of the Vampire shamed even
him.  In the time it takes to sigh, the fight was over.  Radiant lay
bleeding on the ground, his neck slashed wide open.  The Master leaned over
him, and in a laughing tone "You shall not die, you will suffer this
contemptuous act for all eternity".  Radiant died then, not the death we all
come to, a worse kind of death.  The death of his soul.  Since that day,
Radiant has stalked the night alone, seeking refuge from the beasts within,
and release from that which locks him from the light of day.  Cursed
eternal, where be the freedom so desperately sought?

I was born in a small village far from here, My mother was a human and my father was an elf. 
Luckily I took my fathers race.  When I was just a baby some men came in the village and 
attacked us. I was hidden but my parents were killed.  I have an older brother who I am 
searching for. I have no information on him except he is here.  I searched the land until 
I found New Thera since I was young and inexperienced. I took a few jobs hunting people that 
did evil things.  I met a few people along the way. They were friendly to me, but then I 
met Bingoboy. I fell in love.  He helped me when I was in trouble. I owed him my life. 
He told me of a group of people I should meet.  That is how I met the Army of Darkness. 
I knew I didn't belong there but I was new to the city and they took care of me. 
After a few days I found out what type of people they are and decided to leave.  Then 
I met Martijn and was told about the struggle.  I have always been in touch with the 
sky. From a little girl I have sat all day long looking at the birds flying. Feeling the 
wind on my face.  There is nothing like being free as the wind, from the most peaceful 
day to the deadliest storms, Air shows us the true nature of man.

When Kyree was 12, his home was attacked by the vampires.  His friends
and family tried to flee.  Most didn't make it Kyree ran off into the forest
and lost track of the rest of his people.  While he was running he found a
cave with a lake nearby.  He hid in the cave for a couple of days, then he
went exploring.  While out he met some of the other creatures of the forest.
He got to know these creatures really well, and considered them his new
family.  After a while though, he got restless and left.  He traveled
through the lands until he ended up in Thera.  Upon finding Thera he met
many travelers like himself, and made friends among the local populace and
forest creatures.  He decided he would stay in Thera, and begin a new life.
His reason for choosing the element of Sea, is because it can be calm and
soothing when at ease, yet fierce and scary when angered, which matches his
personality.

between the {Ysun{x and {Ww{gi{cn{Wd{x

Her skin, kissed by the {Wmoon{x, and caressed by a {Bd{Ne{Cw {Td{Br{No{Cp{x, is creamy and
smooth.

This child of the {We{Yl{ce{Bm{We{Yn{ct{bs{x is bound to {HT{Gh{be{Hr{Ga{x by the spirit of all, and in
her childlike ways, is destined to become wise and learned.

{CS{Te{Wl{Ce{Tn{We{x was born a 16 yr old girl, and though she will age in yrs, her
youthful looks and innocence will remain the same, for the {We{Yl{ce{Bm{We{Yn{ct{bs{x never
age.

So look out for her, this young girl who is only beginning to taste the
essense of life, for within her unites all the {We{Yl{ce{Bm{We{Yn{ct{bs{x, {bL{Ga{Hn{bd{x, {RF{Yi{Rr{Ye{x, {NW{Ba{Ct{Te{Nr{x
and {WA{gi{cr{x, yet the {Ww{gi{cn{Wd{x rules her {Rh{Pe{Ra{Pr{Rt{x, guiding her feet from place to place,
her thirst for knowledge at times consuming her.

You will find within {CS{Te{Wl{Ce{Tn{We{x all that makes life, for all formed her, yet
over her head you will always see the {Ww{gi{cn{Wd{x, her voice reflects the husky
flow of a soft {Wb{gr{ce{We{gz{ce{x, her hair is ever flowing, never still, and her
laughter  rides the soft caresses of a summer {Wb{gr{ce{We{gz{ce{x, and breaks through
the fierce howls of a {Ww{Bi{Nn{Wt{Be{Nr {Ws{Bt{No{Wr{Bm{x.

{YIn the beginning of time, before man existed, there were the gods. They 
reigned on top of Mount Olympus, and created all that is Thera for their 
pleasure and amusement. Therans, one of their most wonderous creations were 
modeled in the fashion of the gods. Olympians had always wondered what would 
become of themselves had they lost their powers, so the created such an 
outcome. Therans were that outcome.
{WIn their reckless haste they had created but one flaw, a streak of their 
greed, jealousy, hatred, and evil deeds had been imbued in the Therans. 
Without godlike restraints such as the Olympians had this evil ran amok among 
Therans, and tainted many pure hearts and souls. Chaos and dissorder followed, 
and eventually out of the gods control.
{BAngered by this turn of events, the Olympians sought to destroy the Therans 
outright lest this evil grow any stronger. Only one god opposed this action, 
and his name was Thor. He saw the good in all Therans' hearts, and decided to 
protect such rare beauty. By deciding against his peers, he was cast down to 
the ranks of such mortals, never to return to Mount Olympus, until he had
quelled this evil that he saught to tame. So they cast him out, and sealed
the cave of Olympus, so he could not return.
{CBeing of a blood more pure than the crude world the gods had created for 
the Therans domain, he was instantly decomposed into that which made up the 
world, the 4 elements of {PF{Ri{Pr{Re{C, {WA{gi{cr{{ke{C, {BW{Na{Ct{Te{Br{C, and {GE{Ha{Yr{bt{Gh{C. 
Seeing the Therans, bicker amongst themselves for petty things saddened his 
heart...until he found those who respected the very elements the he now was 
made of. For the Queens' Quarter Knots alone were still pure of heart. Full 
of spirit and passion, envigorated in life by the elements they so dearly 
protected, He knew they could help him on his quest to free Therans of the 
curse of evil bestowed upon them by their very creators. They would be his 
army of Light, to battle the dark denizens of Evil.
{YEven now he strives to gather forces of the just, and benevolent, to battle 
against the evil that enslaves their race, and surely means imminent destruction 
by the gods who created them. Join the battle, and gain your freedom.

Meagan's Homeland was destroyed by the evil Vamphyri and her parents were
killed right before here eyes. She escaped just in time by running to the
inner courtyard of the keep and jumping into the well. As the current
surged and pressed in on all sides of the well. Meagan took a deep breath
and swam under the current and out the side hole where the water came in.
She surfacedpast the stone bridge which leads to the Keep and climbed up
the embankment to safety. She took one last look behind her and then
headed off north, towards Thera. Along the way, she met Ladyhawk, who was
wondering around Mahn-Tor, and she was kind and loving toward the
frightened girl. Ladyhawk adopted her and Calvaria and Aerylene became her
family. They taught her everything about being a a warrior and ranger.
During her travels around Thera, she was a mortal, immortal IMP and then
returned to being mortal. She has watched people come and go and 
circumstances happen, either for the good or the bad. Finally her history
is posted. That's it, the end.

aireAeris~
You notice a tall elf that is clad in loose flowing robes that catch his 
beloved Aire Element. You notice a serious and thoughtful demanor on his
face as he realizes the seriousness of his task.  You can see from his 
narrow eyes that he is determined and loyal to the defense of the Elements.
You can barely catch a climpse of his deep purple eyes, the result of his 
infusion of the Aire Element. His shoulder length hair also is dark purple 
and flows freely in the wind. His skin is slightly pale yet radiates a 
magical aura, even from the portrait. His robes are made of silk and 
colored silver with a purple cloak and hood about his body.  His lir, the 
sylph, rest upon his shoulder, smiling brightly.  She has long purple hair 
and purple eyes as well as result from the bond between them.  She wears a 
small grey silk dress that flows. She wears a deep purple belt and you see 
the tips of her leather boots. The scene is a grassy plain where a strong 
gust blows at all times.
~
E
AireAerylene~
	The first thing that draws your attention to Aerylene, is that she 
looks so familiar.  Then you realize that yes, this is Calvaria's twin 
sister.  Their slender, shapely figures and beautifully featured face are 
identical.  But that is where the similarities stop.  Aerylene's golden 
tanned skin glows with a radiance of the sun warming the Land.  Her silver 
eyes gleam without sightlessness, the marking of her Aire element.  A slim 
black eyebrow is slightly lifted in her mischievous smile.  Where her 
sister's white hair crackles and sparks, Aerylene's long thick black hair 
is pulled back in a high ponytail to swing about.  Her body is clothed in 
soft leather breeches and sleeveless tunic in the rich tones of the Land.  
Curled about her kneelength boots is her winter lynx, Bailey.  The small 
gorgeous cat gazes out at you with her deep amber colored eyes.  The 
setting of the painting is atop Ladyhawk's mountain, where Aerylene can 
feel the Aire and be with the Land.
~
E
aireAndrea~
A dark and enticing woman is depicted upon this canvas.  Her eyes, though
just an artists' rendition of them, seem to peer into your soul, able to
tell your real intentions.  Her picture guards the clanhall, and serves as a
reminder of her presence.  Of the Aire element, she glides through
life with a smile on her face and a warm heart.  Raven black hair cascades
down her heavily armored body.  Though she is husky, she has a strange
grace.  Her Vamphyri blood has given her immortality, and her ageless face
has a serene look of peace on it.  The milk white of her skin, and the
piercing {Cblue{x of her eyes contrasts with her hair.  She has lived a
charmed life, and invites all to sit and listen to her weave a tale of love,
life, and learning.

aireKismet~
As you gaze at this painting it seems to move before your eyes.

The scene he stands in appears to be one of great joy.
He stands in the {TKnot Courtyard{x looking like he is entertaining
lir and member alike with another vivid {Mtale{x and {Msong{x.
As you stop to admire the finely painted picture you swear
you could hear music from somewhere, but you can't seem to place it.
{cKismet{x appears to be not the powerfully built or quick, or even
much of a scholar, but you can tell by the {Rtwo blades{x that he carries
that you would want him on your side for a fight.His {btanned{x complexion 
is a stark contrast to his light colored hair and you can tell by his 
clothing that he is well traveled like the {cAire{x he represents. He 
appears to be nothing special, but fascinating at the same time. At the

As you gaze at the picture of {CS{Te{Wl{Ce{Tn{We{x you notice it is different

off her tall thin build, yet shaped so erotically as only a woman

You lean closer and gasp, you smell her {be{Ga{Hr{bt{Gh{Hy{x scent, and feel the 
heat of the {Ysun{x, you swear you see her deep dark {cbrown{x eyes with 
{Ggreen{x flecks blink at you as her {Rl{Pi{Rp{Ps{x curl into a deeper smile, 
her pale cheeks blush as the {Ww{gi{cn{Wd{x brushes the dew from her soft
{Wmoonkissed{x skin... 

You take a deep breath, close your eyes, and look once again, and 
realise it was not a figmant of your imagination, The portrait of

	Your eyes are almost eclipsed as you open the door to Lirrel's
room.  A small twirling tornado spins quietly in one of the corners.  Here
and there little gales sweep the sun particles in a myriad of dance 
routines.  There is a large white rug in the center.  Windows line the 
entire circular wall, and all are open to let in the winds.  There is a 
pearl white dais in the center of the room.  You step down the two steps 
from the entrance and walk closer to the dais to realize that what you 
thought was a statue is really an apparition of Lirrel, a strand of the 
Original Queen's Quarter Knot.  Long ago, when Lirrel's sister Zorah, 
killed Lirrel's snow owl lir, {CTiernan{x, Lirrel died with him.  Now she 
rests here eternally with the band of Elementals, counseling and healing 
them.

	{gAn {Mi{Vn{Md{Vi{Mg{Vo{x scarf is draped over the painting of a beautiful {Wwhite{g 
haired woman.  This portrait you recognize, is of Calvaria.  She is 
standing alongside the {TSi{Wle{Can{T Oc{Wea{Tn{x.  The vast sea green water mirrors 
the intensity and depth of her almond shaped eyes.  Her long, unruly 
ivory hair  is tied back with a piece of leather, only to let a few 
locks spark and curl to frame her heartshaped face.  The paleness of her 
skin reveals that she is no longer of the realm of the living, but an 
undead vampire.  Her deep red lips are pulled back in a seductive smile 
to reveal the tips of her fangs.  A swirl of {Bde{Nep {Bbl{Nue {gcloak drapes over 
her slender shoulders to swing about her bare shapely legs.  Her long 
sapphire colored dress is almost eclipsed by the folds of the cloak.  A 
slender hand is nestled deep within the white fur of her wolven lir, 
{MMa{Vnti{Tco{Cre{g, standing protectively beside her.  His deep emerald colored 
eyes sparkle with both mature wisdom and childish mischief.  You stand
back and admire the powerful priestess and her beloved companion.
~
E
seaLadyhawk~
As you stand and gaze upon the portrait of Ladyhawk, you see a figure,
slight of build standing straight, only a mere 5 feet tall.  Long and
thick dark eyelashes outline her wide, sea-green eyes that stare out to
sea with a sense of deep calm.  Her dark, emerald green velvet hooded robe
flowing gracefully to the ground.  The bodice is white, delicate hand
crocheted lace just barely tipping over her swelling breasts.  Just
peeking out from under the folds of her gown are small, black, soft glove
leather shoes.  Her face is round, smooth pale skin, with a tiny scar on
her lower right cheek.  (They say when she was a small child, she was high
in a tree believing she could stretch her wings as her name implied.  Alas,
not so, the ground was hard and unyielding, ending with a little kiss from
the earth.)  The sun dances on her hair, long, blonde, like cornsilk.  Not
overly thick, but  with a mind of its own, wisps stray here and there.
There is but one piece of jewelry adorning her.  A small, delicate, gold
chain around her neck.  On the chain is a piece fashioned to resemble a
girl.  A round, clear, perfect diamond forms the head, below that a
triangular aquamarine for the body/skirt with four tiny chains attached
to symbolize the arms and legs.  A gift from her daughter, Calvaria, that
Ladyhawk never takes off.  Ladyhawk stands next to her stallion, Cresue.
A beautiful, large steed, shining gold in color and four white stocking
legs, with a long white, flowing mane and tail.  Her slender arm poised
with her small hand resting upon his withers.  They stand together on the
high cliff overlooking the sea at Flaming Five Mountain.  The sky is
sapphire blue, no clouds in sight.  A gentle breeze touching them ever so
lightly.  They are calm, powerful, and in control.
~
E
seaSuntzu~
As you gaze upon the portrait of SunTzu, you are immediately seized by the
power and compassion which appear in his ice blue eyes. His half-smiling 
face is topped by a mass of light-brown hair, streaked with gray, and 
pulled into a tail. Around his neck is an amulet of sapphire shaped to a 
water droplet. He is dressed in the loose-fitting clothes of a wandering 
samurai: oversized, loose shirt and pants of purple, white wrap-shirt 
beneath. Tight around his waist are his katana and wakazashi. The gold 
threads woven throughout his overshirt coalesce into 5 stars extending 
down his left arm, and 9 planets down his right. He is standing upon the 
shore, facing the ocean. White and pink cherry blossoms fill the air 
behind him. Once again, you feel inexorably drawn to his smiling,
penetrating eyes, and you know the greatness of SunTzu.
~
E
seaSmiley~
Smiley seems to glow as if she knows a long and forgotten secret.
Her hair flies behind her as she seems to walk over the Theran Ocean.
Even As you look at her, you just know she's part of something bigger.
She has helped many, while being helped by her fellow {TQuarter Knots{x.
She stands in the middle of four shrines. One goes to Dakkon - {PO{Rn{Pe 
{RW{Pi{Rt{Ph {RT{Ph{Re {PF{Rl{Pa{Rm{Pe{x, one to Calvaria, {CL{Ta{Cd{Ty

{CL{Ba{Cd{By{x, and one to Kittens - {VF{Cu{gr{VW{Co{gm{Va{Cn.  You can tell
that she is very {Pg{Br{Ya{Gt{Ve{Wf{Pu{Bl{x to these four people, and hopes
to return the favors that they have given her.  While being helped by her
fellow clanmembers and alongside her trusty Pegasus {WS{Yun{WS{Yhine{x, 
she fights for {YT{Wruth, {YJ{Wustice, {YA{Wnd {YT{Whe {bL{Ye{Wga{Yc{by{x

seaTiddles~
The sea seems calm and gentle as the rays of sunlight hit its surface 
and are refracted into a myriad of pretty colours reflected off the 
waves. On the shore in front of the water, his foot placed on a
convienient rock stands Tiddles, obviously posing for the artist.
Tiddles is fairly small for his kind, probably the runt of the litter,
and though he poses in such a way to look as powerful and imposing as
he can, he doesn't look as if he'd ever make a very good warrior.
Tiddles is a feral, a cat-like creature with gentle orange, yellow,
red and black stripes over his fur. He has black on yellow eyes and
a set of fairly long well-kept whiskers. He also has a tail which seems
to be curled up in a rather uncomfortable position, but it was obviously
what the artist considered an ideal way for it to be and it does
extenuate the rest of the portrait. Then there's the teeth. Ferals being
cats are carnivores and do have fierce canines at the best of times.
Tiddles', however, seem to be a fair bit longer than even a feral's 
should be. Either the artist got them totally out of proportion, or
there's more to Tiddles than meets the eye.  In fact, you could be
forgiven for feeling that Tiddles doesn't belong out in the sun where 
the artist has put him. Standing by the foot which is on the ground is
a small blotch of red. This is the artist's representation of Tiddles'
fox lir, though it's obvious by this time the artist just couldn't be
bothered.

Although Alexia doesn't glow or change into air like her spouse, she does
have some outstanding qualities that make her stand out and be noticed. 
When you look at her hair and eyes, you can't help but wonder if she's all
human.  Her long blonde hair is loosely braided, hanging to the middle of
her back.  Within these braids are black strands that are entangled within
the hairs.  These black hairs do not look like normal human hair; Instead,
they look rough, and make you quiver with uneasiness when you touch them,
making it uncomfortable to.  She has bright blue eyes that seem to captivate
you, leaving you feeling hollow inside.  It almost makes you quiver because
you get the feeling that she's seen everything you are, and all of your
secrets.  You study the eyes, remembering they are rumored to grow a deep
red when she gets angered or upset.  The rest of her body appears to be of
human form.  She has long, beautiful legs that keep you drawn to her.  Just
as you can see why Alexia could fall in love with Asmadi, it is obvious why
people are drawn to her.  She shows a lot of friendly features, and with her
unusual traits, it shows just how extraordinary she really is.

seaKvass~
{CThere is a man at the center of this Portrait. He has on a pair of
sunglass, a black three-button (gold) jacket, a pair of black pants, dress
shoes, and blue polo shirt and a light blue tie. He is also holding a long,
1inch in diameter pole, which he looks like he is twirling around in a very
cool way. At his feet lay K.O.ed high-ranking Sovite officials (Stalin,
Lenin, etc. [Not Gorby]) as well as Mao, and all those red commies. The man
is standing in red-square. The bricks are cracked, and there are a few
bondfires around. Red Communist flages burn in the background, and statues
of Lenin, Mao, etc. are being removed. You can see a drunken-fat man on the
Kremlin waving a Tri-Color flag. The fat guys looks like he's had a little
too much Vodka, shall we say? (Note: The Vodka line is in honor of Mara, not
that I'm comparing The fatty (Boris) to Mara, cause she doesn't look like
that, but, never mind (Sorry Mara)) The man in the suit, who looks like he's
just gotten revenge seems to have a certain look in his deep-brown eyes. His
brown wavy hair is obviously being blown by the wind. Below the portrait is
a golden-plaque which reads : Moscow, 1991, moments after the communists
lost Power. Man in suit is Kvass, Fat-Drunken-Russian is Boris Yeltsin.

	When you walk through the water wall you are amazed that not a 
single drop has saturated your gear!  There is a whirling tidepool in the 
center of the room.  You walk around the raised outer edge of the rim.  
Lir of every kind inhabit this sanctuary.  Falconers, panthers, bears, 
and even the creatures of the Sea all wait here till the time has come for 
the bonded to choose a lir.  Lirs are very special and important to the 
Knot.  If a lir is sick, the bonded gets sick.  And never mistake an 
Elemental's lir for a "pet."  The lir are far more intelligent and 
characteristically charmed for that.  Nyctasia, the once Water strand 
of the Queen's Quarter Knot has taken it upon herself to take care of 
the Lir.  {CNauticus {xher dolphin lir, was killed by Queen Zorah and

	{gAn {Mi{Vn{Md{Vi{Mg{Vo{x scarf is draped over the painting of a beautiful {Wwhite{g 
haired woman.  This portrait you recognize, is of Calvaria.  She is 
standing alongside the {TSi{Wle{Can{T Oc{Wea{Tn{x.  The vast sea green water mirrors 
the intensity and depth of her almond shaped eyes.  Her long, unruly 
ivory hair  is tied back with a piece of leather, only to let a few 
locks spark and curl to frame her heartshaped face.  The paleness of her 
skin reveals that she is no longer of the realm of the living, but an 
undead vampire.  Her deep red lips are pulled back in a seductive smile 
to reveal the tips of her fangs.  A swirl of {Bde{Nep {Bbl{Nue {gcloak drapes over 
her slender shoulders to swing about her bare shapely legs.  Her long 
sapphire colored dress is almost eclipsed by the folds of the cloak.  A 
slender hand is nestled deep within the white fur of her wolven lir, 
{MMa{Vnti{Tco{Cre{g, standing protectively beside her.  His deep emerald colored 
eyes sparkle with both mature wisdom and childish mischief.  You stand
back and admire the powerful priestess and her beloved companion.

E
flamedakkon~
	Here lies the portrait of Dakkon Blackblade.
{cThe first thing you notice is the way he almost blends into the dark,
bleak background. His jet black hair, piercing dark eyes, and black 
cloak all seem to fade in and out, as if to hide his presence. His 
features are stern and emotionless, as if trying to shut out the mortal
world, with all their foolish emotions and petty things. A great weapon
rests on his back, the blade as black as midnight, merging with the rest
of the portrait. By pure chance, you notice something odd with one of 
the corners of the portrait, something you're sure that wasn't there 
Before. It seems as if some c{golor is s{Wlow{Gly encroachi{Cng on the
boundaries of the picture. Perhaps, {Hs{Go{gm{We{go{Gn{He {gexists, so full

flameMadcat~
Madcat stands, the very pillar of sanity on top
of a rocky beach ball, his tail in a moebius
loop, his head in a Klien bottle. 
Behind him the background is purple with the sun
dazzling everything with it's bubbley blue brightness
in the distance a cucmber can be clearly seen 
riding a bicycle, while a hamburger flies lazily
in apparent circles about Madcat's head.
sat at Madcat's feet is his Lir, an advocat
called simon and his pet tiger call Kwesterriforum.
His tiger is covered in clear yellow, black and
red stripes and it's lionesque mane is quite 
unusual.
Madcat's seems to be smiling at the painter
while he was painted which might account for the
unusual splodges all over the canvass as if the
painter was in a hurry to get away.

E
flameCinnamon~
Fluffy clouds swirl playfully around the figure of a small red dragon in
this painting.  The frame is carved in geometricly styled clouds and fire,
which draw your attention for a moment.  Looking back at the central figure
in the painting, its apparent this dragon is an impish sort, hovering in a
reclining position with a milkshake clutched in her front paws, sipping on
the straw.  Her tail is tipped with black spikes, and is sort of kinked at
the end like its used often as an extra hand.  Stepping closer to the
painting, you can smell the faint wiff of cinnamon oil that was used in the
paint.
~
E
flameradiant~
{T You gaze upon a man clad in powerful obsidian armor.  He is a warrior
by the looks of it, and a strong one.  His face is a wall of mystery.  What
have those eyes of blue flame seen?  What have those slightly pointed ears
heard?  Those lips, what have they spoken, and cried for?  He is handsome,
his expression the epitome of a hardened warrior.  His long flaming mane of
black hair, and tanned skin hide his long history of pain well.  He has two
long glowing blades at his side, powerful artifacts used in countless wars
and battles.  What have these mithril swords slain?  Who have they saved? 
The painting glows as you look upon it, a flame of blue and black burns
within it, despite the fact this is but a canvas.  A heat engulfs your soul,
and burning desire overtakes you, a pain, a hidden need for something you
cannot name.  You are feeling this warriors soul.  An experience never to be
forgotten.{x

Aidan's Armory~
	A warm sensation washes over you as you gingerly walk through the 
wall of fire to enter the Armory.  The room has a warm reddish glow to it, 
even though the windows are clearly open to let the breeze come and filter  
in.  Like the other elemental rooms, this room is constructed to have a pit 
like center, with a relatively large walkway around the outer rim.  A 
blazing fire emits sparks from the circular pit.  From the size of it, 
you would think it would bring down the Keep in a towering inferno.  But 
Aidan, a Fire Elemental tends to it and makes sure it doesn't get out of 
hand.  You look over at him and wonder what it is he is constructing now.  
{CHart{x, his red fox lir, lies at his feet, basking in the warmth of the

Landaerylene~
	The first thing that draws your attention to Aerylene, is that she 
looks so familiar.  Then you realize that yes, this is Calvaria's twin 
sister.  Their slender, shapely figures and beautifully featured face are 
identical.  But that is where the similarities stop.  Aerylene's golden 
tanned skin glows with a radiance of the sun warming the Land.  Her silver 
eyes gleam without sightlessness, the marking of her Aire element.  A slim 
black eyebrow is slightly lifted in her mischievous smile.  Where her 
sister's white hair crackles and sparks, Aerylene's long thick black hair 
is pulled back in a high ponytail to swing about.  Her body is clothed in 
soft leather breeches and sleeveless tunic in the rich tones of the Land.  
Curled about her kneelength boots is her winter lynx, Bailey.  The small 
gorgeous cat gazes out at you with her deep amber colored eyes.  The 
setting of the painting is atop Ladyhawk's mountain, where Aerylene can 
feel the Aire and be with the Land.
~

landilyatha~
As you look at the portrait of Ilyatha, you notice that it is hard to
see her features real well since she is a shadow.  Her eyes seem to look
seeing who you are and what you are, it sends a cold chill down your spine.
Looking into her eyes, you see a hidden pain, which you cannot determine
but it is always in her mind.  Her features are well defined yet hard to
see.  She has long flowing pitch-black hair.  She is about 5'5" and
extremely quick and agile.  Her reaction time is very quick, her senses
are very acute, not much gets by her.  You can tell by her look that
she is very emotional, anger or passionate.  She is also very muscular and
strong.  She is almost always dressed in pitch-black silenced armor
so she can sneak up on her opponents.  Ilyatha looks like a cold-hearted
warrior that has a passionate side.
~
E
landmnementh~
Before you stands a portrait of Mnementh.  His interesting personality
is shown well by the fact that he, a dragon, constantly in the air, chose
the {HL{ba{Gn{Hd{x element as his own.  Many would wonder at this choice, but it
made perfect sense to him.  He always loved the land, and also held a great
respect for the other elements.  He tried always to lend a helping hand to
those who needed it, and tried to allow everyone the benefit of the doubt.
Mnementh appears to be a person that has strong beliefs and is willing to
back them up with force, but only if there is no other way.

leafy vines scatter and drape over the ceiling.  The smell of the dry
leaves fills the room with warm and wonderful fragrances.  Aslynn, the
Earth strand of the fabled Quarter Knot, is here.  Her great black bear
lir, {CDrakke{x, rests atop a large sun warmed rock to one side of the vast
room.  You smile in respect to the beautiful auburn haired woman seated
beside the lir.  Zien is seated on a tree stump in the center ring.  He
finds a certain companionship with his goddess and chooses to remain with
her in the haven.  A screech from the tree tops brings a greeting to you

A Dark and Quiet Grotto~
Entering, you are struck by the cool and clammy air. You hear 
condensation dripping from the walls, and a small gurgling spring 
somewhere off to your left. You smell brine. As your eyes adjust to
the light (whatever you brought with you, there is no light here
at all), you see that you are standing on a black sandy beach in a 
large cavern, obviously carved out both by an underground inlet from
the sea to the south, and by the spring which enters the cavern from 
above and to the east. The salt water is quite calm in here,
although if you stand gawking at it long enough, you will be able to 
measure its tidal flow, which amounts to a couple of feet, as you may 
be able to tell by the barnacles, seaweed, and algae on the walls.  
There are footprints in the sand, but no other evidence of habitation. 
If anything lives here, it must be a creature of water, indeed!

{RTemperant's Escape{x~
{RIt seems you have entered an {Yinf{Rer{Yno {Ras you look about the walls 
made up of tall {Yfla{Rme{Ys, {Rand the floor looks to be hot coals, waiting 
to blister your tender skin.  {YYet the {Rair is not smokey by anymeans. 
Over to the far wall is a large bed with red silk sheets tumbled about as if 
a {Yfl{Rame {Yele{Rmen{Ytal {Rhas awaken not moments before.  Next to the 
bed is a small obsidian table with {Ygold {Rveins running through it.  
Glancing about the room, you notice that there is a lack of closets and 
dressers. What type of {Yfla{Yme e{Rlem{Yent{Ral wouldn't need clothing?{x
