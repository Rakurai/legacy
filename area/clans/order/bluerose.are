Sergeant Zim~
Sergeant Zim is going to make a soldier out of you or kill you trying.
Perhaps even both.

Looking neat and immaculate in his black uniform, this big, mean-looking man is
the very picture of a proper, efficient soldier. For some reason, though, he 
doesn't look very happy to see you. You catch the occasional scathing comment 
about the apes he is stuck having to babysit.

Here stands a wiry old man, his beard barely that of what you would think
a mage's should be. His Fiery red robe flows around him. You notice a
ring on his finger, it has a flame pictured on it. You look into his
gray eyes coming to realize that this man had once been of a group
of very powerful mages. There are books scattered about around him.

{NT{Ba{Crm{Ba{Nc{x~
Under the sharp, critical scrutiny of the drill instructors, recruits putting
in their various services for the {NO{Br{Cd{Be{Nr of the B{Blu{Ne R{Blu{Ne{x practise
an endless variety of skills, from armed and unarmed combat to improvised weaponry;
knife-throwing, magic, brewing, scribing and stealth manoeuvres to name but a few.
For a very few truly brave souls, Sergeant Zim is here to offer more personal
instruction. This skilled, dedicated craftsman never seems to crack a smile,
though; as he catches your eye he barks out a command to fall in with the other
apes.

{TThe Order of the {BBlue {TRose{x~
You stand before a giant table, where many descions of {Pwar
{xand {Rtrade{x are made. At the end of this hall there is a picture
of the good lady {Ybuttercup {xin her fine {Ycrown {xand bright {Bblue 
{xdress.{B Memorys{X fade into {Treality{x as you gaze into those 
beautiful {Bblue{x eyes... Why are the ones so needed taken
so soon?

You enter into a clearing surrounded by large {Gtrees{x that block out all 
{Ylight{x. {GL{be{Ga{bv{Ge{bs{x rustle beneath your feet and fearsome howls fill the
nights air. {CS{gp{Cl{ga{Cs{gh{Ci{gn{Cg{x and the smell of {Cfresh water{x tickles your senses.
{PRed little beady eyes{x stare at you from the {cdarkness{x of the shrubberies
around you. {YW{gi{Yn{gd{x blows through bringing a {Cc{Th{Ci{Tl{Cl{x along with it. As you
breathe out {Yair{x you can see it {Cm{gi{Cs{gt{x before your eyes. Looking upward,
you see that the {Gtrees{x block out even the minimal {Ylight{x the {Ym{go{Yo{gn{x would 
normally afford.

Banon's Room Of Guard~
As you enter, you hear a gentle lute musique from the walls. In this room
you feel VERY safe. There are twin altars at each side of the room and a
giant pedestal at the front. You can make out a figure in the back of the
room that keeps a close eye on you but does not seem to pose a threat. He
seems to be creating an endless amount of emblems, crests and other
decorations to increase the majesty of this place. As you approach the
pedestal, a gentle light seems to fill the area.

Upon entering this room you {Bmarvel{x at the three extremely large {Bcatapults{x 
drawn taut, facing different directions in the room. You conclude that they 
launch {BBlue {xRose Knights all over {GThera{x. You wonder what sort of wild ride 
they will offer as you tentatively approach one.

{BBlue {TRose{x {PForging Hall{x~
{xYour first impression of this room is the {Psearing {Rheat {xthat assults you as
you enter. This is where many a {BBlue {TRose{x {xhas forged a weapon and made
themselves legendary, not only as a renowned {GTheran {Wwarrior{x, but as a great
weaponsmith as well. Shards of {gs{ct{ge{ce{gl, {ciron, {gadamantite, and other types
of metal are strewn on the floor. The clan forge stands here, waiting to birth a new
instrument of beauty...or of death.

{RL{Pi{Rb{Pr{Ra{Pr{Ry{x~
As you step through {Yw{bi{Yd{be {Ya{br{Yc{bh{Ye{bs {xleading into a
library, your eyes widen at its sheer size. In the
middle of the room stands a chair. This chair has a
{Wwhite cushion {xwith a {Bb{Clu{Be r{Cos{Be {cembroidered{x on it. It is
here for you to sit while you read if you so desire.
There are shelves that reach high into the {Csky{x filled
with books of all types. One modest-sized section
holds {Vrecords{g dating back to times before the {NO{Br{Cd{Be{Nr of
t{Bh{Ne B{Blu{Ne R{Bos{Ne {xcame into existence. Most the other books
are either fiction or simply about cities, creatures,
spells and world geography. Some even tell of myths that
may actually be true; you never know.
