  we wander --

  we know
  and yet are decieved

  we thrive
  and yet we drown

  we grow
  and we are dwarfed

  we are alone
  and never lonely

  we are lost
  and we are found.{x

  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.{x
