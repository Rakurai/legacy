sacrilege by any whom might enter here, and dispatches those she sees
fit with horrid efficiency.  None escape her gaze, just as none provoke

When you love someone, you do not love them all the time, in exactly
the same way, from moment to moment. It is an impossibility. It is
even a lie to pretend to. And yet this is exactly what most of us
demand. We have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life, of love,
of relationships. We leap at the flow of the tide and resist in terror
its ebb. We are afraid it will never return. We insist on permanency,
on duration, on continuity, when the only continuity possible, in life
as in love, is in growth, in fluidity - in freedom, in the sense that
the dancers are free, barely touching as they pass, but partners in the
same pattern. The only real security is not in owning or possessing,
not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a
relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia,
nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation, but living
in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships
must be like islands, one must accept them for what they are here and
now, within their limits - islands, surrounded and interrupted by
the sea, and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.

around you you can see the destruction caused by the powerful storm. White
hot flashes of lightning flicker from the depths of the hurricane.  But
everything is strangely peaceful in here, with the sun shining in from above
and a flock of birds winging across the sky.  You stretch out and relax, this

A Dark Cavern~ 
The room is dark and musty. As you travel farther into the cavern, your boot
kicks something solid and bounces around causing echos to fill the air. As you
light a torch to see what was creating the clatter, you gasp in suprise as you
see the huge amount of treasure that lies before you. There are piles upon
piles of {Yg{bo{Yl{bd{x, {Vj{Be{Vw{Be{Vl{Bs{x, {Nm{Ma{Rg{Ni{Mc {Ri{Nt{Me{Rm{Ns{x, and other rare and exotic items. As you 
begin to clamber up the side of one of the mounds of treasure, you also 
notice the {Ws{gkulls{x and {Wskel{ge{Wtons{x of other brave souls who have dared to 
disturb the inhabitant of this cavern. As you contemplate your next course 
of action, you hear a great commotion behind you. Rising up from within 
the treasure you see the head of a large black dragon, the smell of its 
breath causing you to wretch. The dragon hisses "you will pay for waking 
me from my slumber. Now, feel my wrath." With a sharp intake of breath, 
the great dragon known as {cKaz{gan{cder{x shoots forward an icy blast that 
instantly freezes and shatters your body.

you are protected from the weather in your cozy cave.  The foamy surf

love~
For those who seek that elusive thing called love, my only advice is to not.
When it wants to be found, it will be, whether or not you wish it to be so.
It will catch you unawares, when you least expect it.  Take a good look at
every face around you, every spirit you know, every friend you cherish, every
being you despise.  For love could chain you to any.  

For those who have love, cherish it and nurture it; do not deprive it with
worries or it will wear thin.  And for those who do not believe that love
hurts, they clearly have never experienced it.  The pain of loving someone
is the greatest pain of all, the everlasting ache in your heart which can
never be healed.  But bask in love when it is yours, for to be embraced by
the caresses of true love is happiness beyond description.  

{MLove is patient and kind,
Love is not jealous or boastful,
It is not arrogant or rude.
Love does not insist on its own way,
It is not irritable or resentful,
It does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices at right.
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never ends.
So faith, hope, love abide,
these three, but the greatest of these is {VL{Wo{Vv{We{x
~
E
wisdom~
{TThe following are a few words of wisdom that I've accumulated over the years:

If life were not complicated, if it went exactly the way you wished it to be,
would it be worth living?  What is spring if there is no winter?  It is because
life is not boring, because we keep on learning from mistakes, that we have the
urge to continue.

New tomorrows were created to make up for the bad todays.

A smile costs nothing, but is worth a lot.  Wouldn't the world be a little
better if everybody smiled more?

When in doubt, shut up. 

Always strive for compassion, for it is that which separates humans as a race.
The ability to put others before ourselves, to think from somebody elses shoes.
You might be surprised to find that when you give a little, you get a lot.

Nobody likes a whiner.

It is NOT better to have loved and lost than to never have loved before... and
yet, it is not like we have any choice whether or not to love.  So... why not
enjoy it while you can?

Never hesitate to hug.  What other gesture conveys innocent affection as
strongly as a hug?{x  
~
E
success~
1. Never give up on a dream.
2. It never hurts to plan for your future.
3. It's okay to make mistakes.  It's not to make them again.
4. Never be afraid to try something new.
5. Hear from everybody.  Listen to your loved ones.  Trust yourself.

{Bit all amounts to this:

{CIf you want something hard enough, you will work for it.
If you work for it hard enough, it will be yours.{x

An overflowing office~
The very act of entering this cramped room involves shoving aside enough 
paper to have a place to stand.  Sitting is almost out of the question, 
unless you want to use a stuffed briefcase as a cushion.  A torch in the 
corner is the only source of light, and a rather dangerous one, at that.  
You do have the feeling that a large fire would be the only way to reduce 
the amount of trash and paperwork cluttering this room.  Directly behind 
a small desk is a large map of Thera.  You note with anxiety that some 
spaces on the map are crossed out, while others are circled.  The only 
other objects of note in the room are a small compass and an abacus.

{WA {Cbe{Ta{Cut{Ti{Cfu{Tl {Bbedroom{x~
The first sensation that you feel as you walk past the {Wlace-draped{x doorway, 
into this bright, {Ysunny{x bedroom, is sinking into the 2 inch deep, plush 
{Bblue carpet{x that spreads across the large room.  The walls are all {Wwhite{x, 
{Wi{Cl{Wl{Cu{Wm{Ci{Wn{Ca{Wt{Ce{Wd{x by two big windows directly across from you that let the {Ysun{x 
shine through.  A huge birch-framed bed lies in one corner, the overstuffed 
mattress just {Vt{Me{Vm{Mp{Vt{Mi{Vn{Mg{x you to bounce on it.  A curious little {bheap{x lies on 
top of the {Cbaby blue s{Ta{Ct{Ti{Cn s{Th{Ce{Te{Ct{Ts{x, which soon stretches and yawns to turn 
into an adorable little puppy that turns and blinks it's sleepy eyes at you.  
The birch desk in the corner holds the only evidence of {WL{Ci{Br{Ci{Te{Wl's{x current 
occupation, with {Ba{Nm{Bu{Nl{Be{Nt{Bs{x and {cscrolls{x scattered across the surface.  You

Tomb of Necromancy~
  Evil lurks on the walls as you peer around at the shadows
surrounding you.  They creep in on you.  Slow, persistent,
and consuming.  The voices of ghosts from the past fill your
fading mind.  A mind that appears to be slipping away as you
soon become content with your surroundings.  You now feel at
one with the dead.  Suddenly, the room is much more than just
a physical place.  The presence of many can be felt.  Are
they ghosts, demons, or zombies?  Whatever it is, it is beyond
imagination, and truly sinister.  The future is at hand, and
your life as you knew it is behind you.

The Altar of Necromancy~
  You have taken your first step into the realm of the unknown;
the domain of the undead.  You feel very different as you notice
the tingling sensation that surges through your lifeless body.
What you feel is more power than you ever could have imagined.
You now hold the power and knowledge of the vampire.  Settling
your thoughts, you begin to glance about the room, admiring its
many decorations.  The {Cwalls{x are all constructed of an ebony
granite which are smooth and cold to the touch.  In each of the
five corners of this pentagon shaped room stands a {Ctorch{x burning
a dark light.  Together they provide just enough illumination
to read some of the carvings on the walls.  In the middle of the
room is a circular fountain which is filled with a rich mixture
of dark blood.  Blood which pours down from a small opening in
the ceiling of stalactites.  The sight is awe inspiring.

The Guest Immortals' Room~
   This room is devoted to those immortals who do not have a room of
their own.  There are diagrams hanging up on the walls on how to use
your godlike powers to torture mortals and change global weather
patterns.  Two small recliners line the north edge of the room and
a large leather couch is on the west wall.  There are no doors or
windows and the ceiling is made of a swirling gas material.  It appears
to be a portal of some sort that will allow living beings to be sucked
in and out of it with ease.

In the Spring of Growth, you begin learning and experiencing lessons
which will equip you for your long journey. Depending upon how you
use what you learn, your skills and spells will continue growing,

maturity~
The Autumn of Maturity is a time for reflecting upon past experiences,
drawing upon your understanding and sharing it with others that are
still in the seasons before. Your assistance to others is invaluable.
Based upon wisdom you attained during your previous seasons, you
are looked upon as almost all knowing. But, as with all things, you
pass into the next season.

Winter Twilight descends upon all mortals, and passing into this season
you slow down. Looking deep within yourself to find answers about who
you are and where you are going, your mortality is questioned. Having
almost reached the end, you contemplate a mortal's final decision of
rebirth or immortality.

Montrey's Bedroom~
Your feet sink into a thick {Wwhite rug{x as you step into this room.  This is
where Montrey spends the small amount of time that he's not working somewhere
about the realm, and where he only brings the most special of guests.  Very few
see this room, which isn't a terrible disappointment, because it's not much to
see.  Simple {bwood{x floors and walls, reminiscent of a log cabin, give the
room a small, cozy feeling.  The wall opposite you is one huge window, with a
panoramic view of {Wsnow capped{c mountains{x.  A desk is placed against one
wall, with papers and maps strewn about the top of it.  A small cooler sits
near the desk.  A large bed takes up the center of the room, with the foot
facing the window.  Other than that, the only furnishing in the room is a shelf
on one wall, holding a few mementos from times gone by.

Iridescent crystal beams of moonlight illuminate the azure sky, framing

gentle wave across the endless vista carrying the soft, sweet sound of
melodic strings.  As if in perfect counterpoint, there is a barely audible
whisper that seems to play among the woodwinds.  There is a sense of other
worlds, other times.  This realm is permeated by an incredible sense of
relaxation that seems to lift and banish all feelings of stress and tension.
This is the time to dream, to reflect, to clarify.
