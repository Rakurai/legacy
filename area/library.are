'I'll take the quest,' he heard himself say and then cursed himself, he
was a character in a novel, he'd do anything the writer wanted him to do.
The only time he'd have independent thought was when he could catch the
writer unawared. 'I'm glad,' the priest said, 'Come over here to the table
and I'll show you the map of the area in question. 3 of our most ardent
missionaries are being held against their will in this range of 
mountains,' he pointed to the map and Matthew squinted at it, wondering
why a small village priest would be the one to find a questor. The writer
again no doubt. 'Look,' Matthew said, the idea he'd had when he first saw
the belltower returned to mind, 'Can we go up to the top of the belltower? 
I might be able to see the map better up there.' 'Of course, ' the priest 
replied, 'Follow me.' Matthew followed the priest up the worn wooden 
stairwell that lead to the top of the tower and he glanced out at the
crowd below, as he had anticipated, there were no railings here. Fear
clutched his heart again as he thought about what he must do to free
himself. He ignored the priest and took a step forward to address the
crowd. Anticipation struck him as he knew he was going to outsmart the
writer after all. He shouted, 'I refuse to be the puppet of any third rate
author, I will not be the hero in any cliche-ridden piece of drivel,' and
with that he jumped. It was on his way to his death that it occurred to
him, 'this is what the writer had intended all along.'

the ignoring of one fight. He entered the village looking up at the
church tower, he vowed to himself. I'm not going to go on any quest 
regardless of who sends me. Let's see what sort of a book the writer ends
up with if his main character refuses to perform. I'm not going to jump
through any more hoops. The local priest appeared from the church and looked 
at Matthew happily, he eyed the sword and gave Matthew a big grin. 'Oh my
lord we are in dire need of....' 'No,' Matthew replied cold and hard, he 
looked around him and saw a crowd gathering as if the writer was trying to
shame him into accepting what was no doubt a quest. 'Please,' the priest
said, 'It is a matter of great urgen....' 'No,' Matthew reiterated, but it
wasn't easy, he felt as if something powerful was resisting his will and
it took all his willpower to utter the word. He realized the writer could
just ignore his exclamation, the priest could given him the quest whether
he wanted it or not, then of course he just wouldn't do it.&amp;nbsp; Already
the priest was heading back into the church, maybe the writer hadn't
thought of that. 'Shame,' the townspeople started to boo and hiss at him,
so this was what the writer had in mind, well it wouldn't work he decided
but already found himself entering the church involuntarily following the
priest. Well, the writer couldn't force him to take the quest at least.

doubts and had done that deliberately to make Matthew think he was asleep
after all. Matthew was a little confused, such a move would never get past
the readership. Then again he didn't know the type of reader the writer
was after and he had seen some pretty dire errors which were just ignored
by authors in the past, especially by that Anthony Christopher. The
thought occured, was this being written by Anthony Christopher? No, he
decided, Anthony Christopher probably didn't even exist in the world where
the writer of this particular novel was. He was a fake author in a fake
world. But then when did Matthew become a character in the book? When did
his life begin and why can he still remember his childhood so well? And
why was the axeman standing totally still? Of course, the axeman was
waiting for Matthew to stop thinking so that he could... Thinking, then
every thought he'd had had been put there by the writer, this wasn't a
fantasy novel after all, the whole thing was deliberate. Matthew have had
enough, 'Kill me if you're going to,' he said and he walked passed the
axeman ignoring him. The axeman seemed to consider attacking Matthew from
the rear for a moment but then went to check on his dead comrades. Matthew
wasn't surprised, the writer couldn't finish the novel if Matthew was
killed, he wondered how the readership of the novel would suffer from just

involuntarily followed through, hitting the coshman on the back. He fell
like a bag of potatoes and lay still. Matthew felt an awful fear at the
thought that he'd killed someone, but as he thought he knew the hand had
slain at the command of another and he wasn't at fault. He wondered if any
court in the land would accept such a defense. True to form, the daggerman
stepped forward as the next victim. 'why only one at a time,' Matthew
wondered, maybe the writer is giving him time to get the hang of the sword
before the big fight with the axeman, or maybe the writer couldn't handle
two antagonists at once. Matthew almost felt he was separate from his body
as again the hand moved almost instinctively, the sword slashed and the 
daggerman fell in a heap. Matthew shook his head sadly, he had no doubt he 
was in a novel now, and a bad one at that. He waited patiently for the
axeman and prepared himself to receive some sort of wound, a minor one but
a wound nevertheless to make it looks as if it was a close fight. The man 
lashed out with his sword and then jumped back. ready to defend or strike 
again. Matthew watched in disbelief as the sword returned to being an axe, 
was he asleep after all? No, he decided. He already knew the writer wasn't 
very good, chances were he'd forgotten the weapons he'd given to the 
antagonists. Or, maybe, just maybe the writer was becoming aware of his

here for me to find,' he muttered to himself. He shook his head, if this
was a novel he had no doubt he'd be the finest swordsman in the world, or
nearly, despite the fact that he'd never even seen a sword before. The
only time he'd be beaten would be when it suited the plot and he was sure
that as the first novel in a series he wouldn't meet such a man yet. It
would be something to look forward to except he was sure the writer of
such a story would never succeed in getting it published, that meant no
sequel and no super swordsman to defeat. He buckled the sword around him
and continued into the village, his heart sank as at the very outskirts of
the village he was confronted by 3 ruffians, one armed with a dagger, the
second with a cosh and the third with a axe. The hand of fear gripped him
despite the fact he was sure he should triumph, nevertheless, he felt very
nervous as he pulled the sword from it's scabbard. The rogues approached
him with the scent of blood in their nostrils, the one with the cosh
attacked first and Matthew wondered why when the one with the axe was
probably the better choice, then he realized the writer wanted to dispatch
the henchmen quickly and make it more of a fight between Matthew and the
axeman. 'Well I'm not playing,' Matthew thought to himself and he stepped
out of the way to let the coshman run past, unaware that his sword hand

cold shiver ran along Matthew's back and he just caught himself before he 
lost bladder control. Bladder control? He couldn't remember the last time 
he'd visited the lavatory. He decided to put as much space between him and 
the tree as he could, he didn't mind admitting the rhyme actually working 
had spooked him. He passed the next quarter of a mile as quick as he could 
and saw the outline of the village church up ahead. Maybe he could find
something about this world and if it was a novel no doubt his reason for
existance would make itself known there. He stopped suddenly, there was a 
sword in the drainage ditch that ran parrallel to the road. He had no doubt 
it'd be rusting into nothing, but the handle and scabbard at least looked ok,
maybe it'd just been left there by a passing Knight. Why a Knight, he
thought to himself, true he'd no evidence of modern technology but no
evidence either that it didn't exist. Magic gave the case pretty strongly 
that it was a fantasy world but who said magic couldn't work in a modern day 
setting, if it was rare enough anyway. If everyone had a magical ability
then the modern technologies wouldn't get a look in as everyone would do
everything by magic, but was that necessarily so. He didn't know and
didn't really care. He examined the sword closer, removing it carefully
from it's scabbard. It was free of rust. 'As if someone purposely left it

many of them the magic worked simply through the use of rhyme, almost as if 
all authors of books such as these followed the same rules. No, the author, 
if he existed would also know that and would avoid it like the plague. He 
smiled and had the feeling that if the writer was really as bad as he 
suspected, then he'd probably felt no shame at all in using the same
formula as so many others. He shrugged to himself, felt himself blushing and 
decided he had nothing to lose by trying. But what rhyme? Well he'd be the
first to admit he was no poet, but he suspected somehow it didn't matter. 
This author seemed to be so cliched that the rhyme wasn't important. He 
thought about it a little longer, he decided it should be a ridiculous
rhyme so the magic effect would be something only the worst of writers
would include in a book. But then what, he'd read some pretty dire drivel in 
his time, a lot of writers seemed capable of including anything. Well,
okay something that could only happen by the use of magic then. He glanced 
at a nearby tree and tried to think of a rhyme. 'Tree tree, fly to me.' He 
winced at the words even before he finished saying them, that was sure to do 
nothing, even in the most dire of books. But he was wrong as the tree yanked 
itself out of the ground, grew a pair of wings and flew over to him before 
it planted itself back into the ground again directly in front of him. A

character at all, but if the author was one who couldn't be bothered, then 
the book he was in had absolutely no chance of being published. He laughed
at himself again and told himself to get a grip. Obviously he was 
on the verge of a nervous breakdown, a character in a book indeed. No doubt 
he was still suffering from being struck by lightning or something. 'Is
there a town near here?' he asked the farmhand. The farmhand pointed down 
the road and replied, 'There's a small village about two miles in that
direction, a single constable, a church, a grocery store and a tavern. That 
sort of thing.' 'That sounds fine, thanks,' Matthew replied and started 
heading along the road, possible ideas coming and going and a nagging
doubt that he was in some sort of novel. He decided to put it to the test. 
If this was a novel and he, a man of the space age, has somehow entered a
dimensional gateway to a fantasy world, then he must be the hero. He'd
read maybe more of that type of book than he was willing to admit and he
knew that despite the fact that magic didn't work on the 'real world' here, 
he'd be the most powerful mage in existance. He giggled to himself at the 
thought, what a ridiculous idea. Nevertheless, it would be easy to try, now 
then, how did magic work in this realm. Matthew sighed and grinned as 
another silly idea hit him, but he'd read so many books of this ilk and in

mean yes, but I'm not a wizard.' The farmhand smiled, 'we saw you 
materialize, my lord, you cannot hide that from us, we saw you.' 'Perhaps a 
wizard cast a spell on me sending me here,' Matthew replied trying to humor 
him, 'I really don't remember.' 'There does not exist a wizard that can send 
another such, yet.' Matthew glanced again at the farmhand. How would a 
peasant know the abilities of a single wizard, let alone the limitations of 
all of them. This was a bad dream or, no. The second idea wasn't worth the 
consideration. What if, after all, he was the main character in a rather 
badly written novel. Inwardly he laughed it off, what a ridiculous idea, but 
there was a nagging doubt at the back of his mind, the farmhand would know 
because the writer wanted the farm-hand to know, maybe he had no better way 
of conveying his message to the expected readership. Then he wondered, 'Why 
would I even consider such an idea, I know I'm real, I'm alive. But a
writer, especially a bad one could put doubts in my head. But to what
purpose, surely such doubts would simply ruin the story. Whoever heard of a 
book character knowing he was a book character.' It was a silly idea. 'Are 
you sure you're okay?' The farmhand asked. 'I'm fine thanks,' Matthew 
replied. The archaic talk was still missing, it wasn't a novel, unless the 
author just couldn't be bothered. Hmm, it was bad enough to be a book

he thought to himself. 'My house will materialize behind me.' He turned 
around and the farmhands gazed on wondering what he was looking at. Well,
it wasn't his house. 'Now,' he thought, concentrating. No house. 'Now,' he 
muttered softly, but still the house didn't appear. 'Now,' he spoke audibly 
this time but the house adamantly refused to materialise before him. 'What 
ails you wizard?' The farmhand spoke. That too was interesting, the farmhand 
was still the same farmhand, that was rare in Matthew's dreams where
things at least seemed to change their appearance regularly even if they 
remained roughly what they had originally been. Indeed, the mere fact that
he'd turned his back to the farmhand should probably have been enough to cast
the man into oblivion, 
out of sight out of mind became very real where dreams were concerned. He 
looked about him now wondering again where he might be, there was no evidence 
of technology, no vehicles, or indeed anything that looked more advanced than 
something from the middle ages. 'Time travel,' he thought, 'No that was 
unlikely, the farmhand had referred to him as 'you' and not 'thee', if
he'd learnt one thing from that book, the people had a irritating habit of 
talking in an archaic tongue. 'Are you okay, wizard?' the farmhand asked 
again. 'Well,' he thought, 'if he'd truely travelled through time the locals 
might well confuse him as some kind of wizard.' 'No,' he replied. 'er, I

and yet at the same time curious. Matthew tried to quickly take stock of his 
situation and was worried to find he had absolutely no clue as to what had 
happened, he could only surmise, he'd been struck by lightning and had 
wondered around the rest of the night and most of the day in a daze. He
shrugged helplessly and wondered how he could get home, perhaps one of these 
approaching farmhands would be willing to give him a lift. If he'd somehow
walked here he could probably walk back but he really had no idea where he
was. The nearest of the farmhands held himself back a little waiting for 
support from the others before he came any closer, something had obviously 
spooked them. 'Wassup?' he said, his words sounded slurred even to himself, 
maybe he was suffering slightly from concussion. The nearest farmhand took a 
step back and then posed the question, 'What do you want here, Wizard?' 
Matthew looked quite shocked by this, yet although the comment showed on his 
face it still took a minute or two before it reached his brain. 'Wizard?'
Matthew repeated. 'You did appear suddenly out of thin air, as a wizard
would,' the farmhand told him. Matthew made a silent 'O' with his mouth as 
he thought about it. It was obvious he was still asleep, dreaming. Well he 
knew dreams, he'd caught himself dreaming before and he was able to
control them once he knew beyond a doubt it was a dream. 'Something simple,'

ever bother to finish it. He needed something to help alleviate the
boredom. Maybe some food would help, he went out into the kitchen, but with 
the power off, the best he could manage would be a sandwich of some 
description. He yawned, a sandwich would be better than nothing. He wished 
he'd got some candles in so he could at least see what he was doing. The
lights flickered and then went out again. Well, at least the repair engineers 
were on the right track, maybe the power would return properly before it got 
too much darker. He had to admit he wouldn't have wanted to be with them in 
this sort of weather. There was another flicker of light, this time from 
outside, lightning. Matthew loved to watch the lightning, he decided he'd 
venture as far as the front garden in the hope of spotting some more. 
Watching the lightning would help to kill a few more minutes and maybe the
power would be back by then. He hope so, he'd rather not miss his favorite 
program and that was due to start in less than thirty minutes. Matthew
felt dazed, he looked about himself a little confused as to where he was, it 
seemed to be morning, or was it afternoon? Anyway the night had passed and
his house had vanished. Indeed he seemed to be on some sort of country road, 
a border demarking two farms and on each farm were farmhands, some running 
in apparent terror, but a few of them headed towards him, obviously scared

the power failure, high winds knocking a tree into the power lines, hadn't 
shown any sign of abating. He was just glad it was daylight enough so that 
he could read. He yawned involuntarily and started the next chapter, but he 
was tiring of the book, two hours of such drivel was more than enough and
the words were starting to be meaningless to him. He couldn't concentrate 
and found by the time he had got to the end of the second page he really had 
no idea of when he had just read. His mind was numbing to the novel. 'I
need a rest,' he muttered to himself and he placed the book carefully down 
on the edge of his chair, leaving it open at the page he was on, placed face 
down. He closed his eyes for a minute or two, just to rest them and to maybe 
plan what he was going to do when it started to get dark. It was autumn now, 
it got dark at about 6 already and that was far too early to call it a night. 
Before the two minutes had passed though he had fallen asleep, he snored 
loudly oblivious to the world around him, not that there was anything
about that would he might disturb. Evening drew close and it was the change 
in the light coming through the windows that finally caused Matthew to wake 
up. He felt a little lost at first, where was he, why was the power off,
but he soon realised what had happened. He got up, forgetting where he'd
put the book and knocking it to the floor. He rescued the book, marking the
page properly with a small piece of paper and wondered for a moment if he'd

Unwilling by Leveret

It was simple boredom he knew. The book he had been reading up until 
now was by a well reknowned author, people clamored to buy his books, but
to Matthew Stiles it was third rate drivel. It was true Anthony
Christopher,the author, had a very strong following the world over, people
waited for the next novel to be issued the second they finished the one they
were reading. But fantasy wasn't really Matthew's favorite Genre, he
preferred Science fiction, and novels about a man living in a technological 
age suddenly being displaced into a fantasy world where by some quirk of
fate he became the most powerful man on the realm had quite simply been
done to death. Then of course nearly all the books were the same, the author
followed a formula. Not that Matthew could blame him, he was selling books 
and giving his public what they wanted. It just wasn't what Matthew wanted. 
If nothing else it was something to pass the time and he had plenty of time 
to pass at the moment. He sighed again, it was two hours since the power
line went down, cutting off his access to all other forms of
entertainment, true he could go out, but even the phone didn't seem to be
working at the moment so he couldn't call for a taxi and he lived too far 
from anywhere to bother to try a walk. Besides the weather that had caused

The Elevator by David Dixon [Submitted by Salia]

The elevator suddenly stopped, not the slow deceleration that indicated
stopping at a floor, no, this was more abrupt. The elevator jerked to a
halt, made a grinding noise and then nothing. Bill looked around in
dismay. 'Oh, no,' he began. 'The elevators broken. Great.' He shook his
head in disgust. Another man in the left rear corner of the elevator swore
at the elevator. 'This is just bloody wonderful! Always happens like this
too, right when Im late! Life stinks,' he finished and then added another
oath. 'Oh, thats a way to look at it, Mr. Morbid,' piped up the man
nearest the door. 'Just because the elevators stuck you think life
stinks? What kind of attitude is that?' 'Look here, Mr.
Rose-Colored-Glasses, just butt out of my business, all right?' Mr. Morbid
replied testily. 'Um,' offered a short, quiet looking man from the right
rear corner of the elevator, 'Just how long do you think well be in 
here?' 'Forever,' Mr. Morbid answered darkly, 'theyll leave us in here
till were skeletons and Ill be bleedin late and get fired.' Mr.
Rose-Colored-Glasses ignored Mr. Morbid and gave his own opinion: 'Three
or four minutes max. Well be out of here in no time.' 'Sure,' Mr. Morbid

agreed sarcastically. 'Wonder what caused it?' Short Man asked again.
'Probably a fire,' ventured Mr. Morbid characteristically. 'Oh, my God,' 
said the mousy, feminine looking man standing next to Mr.
Rose-Colored-Glasses grabbing his chest; his voice was high with nervous
excitement. 'Oh, my God, I saw a movie where all these people burned to
death in an elevator' Mr. Rose-Colored-Glasses interrupted, 'Dont listen
to Mr. Morbid over there, hes just got a sorry attitude.' Mr. Morbid, as
he was now known, rolled his eyes and reached inside his pocket for a
cigarette. 'So what do you think caused it, then?' asked Feminine Man, 
his voice still high. 'Oh, it just probably had a little loss of power,
nothing major,' Mr. Rose-Colored-Glasses said with a wave of his hand. 
'Yeah,' agreed Mr. Morbid, 'Probably just a loss of power at the power
plant. Im sure well be out of here in a few weeks. Course, well be out
of food.' Feminine Man nearly fainted but managed to gasp, 'I read, one 
time, where these people had to eat each other to stay alive.' For the
first time, Mr. Morbid smiled. 'You first,' he said looking at Feminine
Man. Mr. Morbid started to light his cigarette. 'Dont do that!' 
Feminine Man said, aghast. 'Why not?' Short Man queried from his spot in
the right rear corner. 'Because,' Feminine Man said, with some

consternation, 'Secondhand Smoke is a dangerous killer, especially of
people of my age group.' Mr. Morbid rolled his eyes. 'Look,' he said,
with a hint of grin creeping onto his face, 'were all going to be dead
anyway, and were going to eat you, so why not have you smoked? If one of
us manages to live, what difference will a little smoke make?' He laughed 
and thumbed his lighter. Nothing happened. Mr. Morbid swore again as his
lighter stubbornly refused to produce a flame. 'Here you go,' said the man
in the front right corner. The man tossed Mr. Morbid a book of matches. 
'Who are you, the Cancer Advocate?' asked a man angrily from the front
left corner. 'Were in a hospital. Youre not supposed to smoke here,
besides, I dont want to breathe any secondhand smoke either.' 'And who
are you, Mr. Pinko-Commie, trying to restrict my rights?' Cancer 
Advocate replied defiantly. 'Hey,' said Feminine Man, 'Hes right, Cancer
Advocate!' 'Thanks,' Mr. Pinko-Commie agreed. 'And for your information,
Im not a Pinko-Commie, I just dont want an elevator full of smoke.' 
'What does it matter? Were all as good as dead anyway,' answered Mr.
Morbid. 'Enough is enough, people,' Mr. Rose-Colored-Glasses said. 'Lets
just all be quiet and Im sure well be out of here soon.' 'Think happy 
thoughts,' intoned Mr. Morbid sardonically. Cancer Advocate laughed. Mr.

Morbid lit the first match. The fire alarm went off and the sprinkler in
the elevator came on, showering everyone in the elevator. Mr. Morbid 
let out a long string of expletives. 'See, I told you life stinks,' he
said to Mr. Rose-Colored-Glasses. Mr. Morbid and Cancer Advocates matches
were ruined. Feminine Man grinned smugly while Mr. Pinko-Commie 
suppressed a chuckle. 'Gosh, arent these the most sensitive sprinkler
systems youve ever seen?' Short Man wondered out loud as the cold water
began to soak them all. 'Yeah, they are,' answered Mr.
Rose-Colored-Glasses sincerely, 'but I feel a lot better now knowing that 
everythings well maintained and were safe.' 'If everythings so well
maintained, than why are we sitting in a broken elevator?' asked Mr.
Morbid with a hint of sarcasm. 'Were probably all going to drown.' 'Oh,
my God,' began Feminine Man, 'I cant swim!' 'My briefcase floats,' Mr.
Rose-Colored-Glasses offered kindly, 'Ill let you hold onto it but were
not going to drown.' Feminine Man started to say something but was 
interrupted. The elevator doors opened, and Bill could see that the
elevator had stopped between the first and second floors of the hospital.
Outside the doors was Doctor Marse. 'For the last time, Bill,' Doctor
Marse said, shaking his head, 'We cant treat your multiple personality
disorder if you dont stay in the ward.'

The Library Entrance~
You stand in front of Thera's libary.. It is colossal.. High stone walls reach
up to the sky. Niches hold statues of the Immortals that rule Thera. As you
look upwards, you see stone gargoyles sitting on corners of the roof, ready to
spew down the rain. You proceed into the hall of the library as quiet as you 
possibly can.
An old librarian sitting behind a desk looks at you as you enter.. She nods
at you as you quietly make your entrance in the library..

Punishment 
by Haze

I was punished for going outside.
There was a killer around my neighborhood.
It scared me, but I did go.
I was playing in the garden when it happened.
I saw the killer, I screamed.
My Heroes came to take him down.
But I was punished for dirtying my gown.
