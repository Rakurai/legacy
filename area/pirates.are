pirate guardian~
The pirate gate guardian~
The pirate gate guardian stands here, guarding the entrance to the Pirate Cave.
~
The pirate gate guardian is on duty to make sure no spies or soldiers of
the various kingdoms who are at war with the pirates enter the cave.  He is
sworn to defend the security of their refuge with his life.  Of the pirates
living here, he is one of few who is a member of neither the Dragon-Pirates
nor the Snake-Pirates, so he won't get involved in those regular squabbles
taking place between these so different groups who nevertheless share one
home.

pirate guard~
The pirate peace guard~
A pirate peace guard is here, trying to prevent the pirates from fighting each other.
~
The pirate peace guard has a tough job. The two different groups of
pirates, the Dragon-Pirates and the Snake-Pirates, living in this Cave tend
to fight each other regularly. In fact, even members of the same group
think nothing of picking a nice fight with one other. So the poor peace
guard has to jump into each fight going on, trying to separate the
opponents. But as he himself doesn't mind a good brawl, it often turns out
that he just heats up the fire instead of cooling it down.

old pirate leg~
The old pirate with a wooden leg~
An old pirate with a wooden leg stands here.
~
The pirate is quite old and has many scars from all the fights he fought in
his life. The worst part is that he lost one leg in a great battle between
the pirates and an armada of ships from the dwarfen kingdom.  The pirates
captured the dwarfen king in that battle and collected a very high ransom
from the dwarfs for letting him go alive. That was the basis for quite a
fortune they have managed to earn until today.  This poor old man, though,
has now to manage with a wooden leg.  On the upper arm of the pirate you
notice a {Ggreen snake{x tattoo.

The spy was sent by the dwarfen king who once was a prisoner of the
pirates. He wants to make sure never to get into that situation again.  So
he sent out some of his men to have a sharp eye on what is going on in the
pirates' refuge. The spy is not a good fighter, but he is great at hiding,
sneaking and finding out secrets. One can understand that he feels quite
uneasy among all those pirates, though.

The king of darklands has reigned his people in a brutal and horrifying

was uncertain if his country would pay any ransom for him. And he was
right. The citizens of darklands were so glad to get rid of them, they told
the pirates they wouldn't even consider paying. Normally, that would have
meant instant death for the king... but the Dragon-pirates didn't like the
thought of killing a prisoner and so they are still thinking about a way to
get rid of him without having to kill him.

The pirate queen~
The pirate queen stands here.

The pirate queen is an old but still very strong woman.  The kings and
queens of the pirates are not determined by birth but by vote.  The pirates
elect their best and most successful admirals as kings and queens when they
are too old for battle. Thus they can still serve their people with their
knowledge and advice. As a reward they receive quite a few privileges, one
of them being that they are NOT to be disturbed in their private cave.
They get VERY angry if somebody dares to do so nevertheless! On the arm of
the pirate queen you notice a {Ggreen dragon{x tattoo.

pirate hermit~
The pirate hermit~
The pirate hermit stands here.
~
The pirate hermit lives on this small island because he can't bear the
crowded caves any longer. All his life he was never really integrated as he
is by far taller, stronger and more intelligent than all the other pirates.
They always respected, but also always feared him. He never could
participate in their fights among each others because nobody dared to risk
to fight with him. So he led a quite lonesome life and one day decided to
rather be alone than lonely in a crowd.  On the arm of the pirate hermit
you notice a {Ggreen snake{x tattoo.

pirate woman~
The pirate woman~
The pirate woman who is in love with the pirate hermit stands here.
~
This pirate woman is in love with the pirate hermit. She never dared to
tell him as he didn't seem to notice her at all. Thus he didn't realize that
she was in quite the same situation as he. Quite outstanding in size and
strength, she wasn't very well integrated in the group either. And to make
it worse, while he belongs to the Snake-Pirates, she was born as member of
the Dragon-Pirates. And although the two groups managed to establish a more
or less working social life in the cave together,  'mixed' couples  are
frowned upon by either sides.  So when the hermit left the cave, the woman
followed him without him knowing.  On this small island she is busy hiding
from him but being near him at the same time.  A sad story, isn't it? On
the arm of the pirate woman you notice a {Rred dragon{x tattoo.

A spy from the dwarfen kingdom tries to hide here.
~
The spy was sent by the dwarfen king who once was a prisoner of the
pirates. He wants to make sure never to get into that situation again.  So
he sent out some of his men to have a sharp eye on what is going on in the
pirates' refuge. The spy is not a good fighter, but he is great at hiding,
sneaking and finding out secrets. One can understand that he feels quite
uneasy among all those pirates, though.

Cave Entrance~
This is the entrance to the Pirate Cave, where the Dragon-Pirates and the
Snake-Pirates live. The Dragon-Pirates are (despite of the fact that they
are pirates) quite nice people whereas the Snake-Pirates are truly evil
folks.  You might wonder why they live in one home together
nevertheless.....  Well... pirates have many enemies and each of the two
groups on their own wouldn't be strong enough to stand against them. But
together they are nearly invincible, even by the mightiest kingdoms. So
they overcame their antipathy against each other and built this VERY large
cave as their common home and refuge.  Before you consider entering there,
think twice! The pirates might not like your intrusion or even consider you
a spy in which case instant death would be certain for you!

Small Tunnel~
This is a small tunnel, leading east. To the south lies a small side
tunnel.  Nothing special catches your eye. Just bare stone walls. It must
have been hard work to form this tunnel out of the rocks. The pirates were
happy to finish the work and didn't even consider spending their time with
artwork or some such just to make it interesting for some uninvited
visitors like you.

Side Tunnel~
This small side tunnel leads  east and west to some private caves.
Although most pirates don't mind living together with lots of people in
very small rooms, there ARE pirates who feel uncomfortable that way. So
they made the great effort to build their own private caves. More and more
pirates see the advantages of that and so more and more private caves are
built.

Cave of the pirate king~
You are standing in the cave of the pirate king. It is a very large room,
and is awash with a rough and mixed kind of splendor not to be found in any
of the other caves in the area. Woven tapestries, inlaid with gold, cover
most of the walls. The few otherwise bare spots on the wall are hung with
golden shields and weapons, obviously more ornamental than functional. Long
oaken tables and benches stand alongside the side walls of the cave. It
seems that booty is distributed at these tables as there are some coffers
overflowing with gold and jewelry standing on them. One of the tables still
holds the remnants of a meal. Though most of it has been consumed, it is
obvious that it must have been a meal fit for a king.

You are standing in the cave of the pirate queen. It is a very large room.
By pirate standards, this room shows the more tasteful and delicate touch
of a woman in its decoration. A few hand-woven tapestries depict battles in
which the pirates conquered the royal fleets of various nations. The floor
is covered in thick pile rugs which lead to... yes, this is a genuine
four-poster brass bed, complete with an overhead canopy. A commode near the
bed holds many of the completely mysterious items of a queen's personal
hygiene and piles of priceless jewelry.

This is the legendary treasure chamber of the pirates. It holds the most

Prison~
This is the prison of the pirate cave. Here the pirates have their
prisoners, mostly king and queens they have captured and asking a ransom
for. Once in a while a pirate is brought here for a crime against the
pirate rules. But this is rare, as pirates have few rules and breaking most
of THOSE is punishable by death.

of decay. As you hurriedly turn to exit this place, you think you glimpse

Sea~
You are deeper on the sea, the bottom of  the sea isn't visible any more.
Looking around you, you see the beach to the very far west.  To the far
east lies a small island, but the way there looks difficult and dangerous.
Strong drifts might prevent you from reaching it.  You notice a school of
fish in the water. Might be a good fishing ground here.

you from reaching it.  Looking around you, you see the beach to the very
far west. It looks too difficult to reach from here, though.

Small Island~
You are standing on a small island. It is a very nice place.  Many plants
and trees prove that the earth is very fruitful here.  You hear birds
singing and see some butterflies passing by.  There is a little vegetable
garden that indicates that somebody seems to live here.  The sea lies to
the north and west, whereas the island continues to the east and south.
The sea at the north shore looks quite calm and inviting, but the sea to
the west is rough and many rocks cause a strong current.
